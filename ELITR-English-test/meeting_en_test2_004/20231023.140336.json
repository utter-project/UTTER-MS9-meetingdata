Yeah.\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\nSo I see that [PERSON5] is here and <unintelligible/> as well.\nSo [PERSON7] any news about your electricity or is it-?\n(PERSON7) Yes, it's back.\n(PERSON12) It's back yeah <laugh/>.\nYeah, it is, yeah-.\nUh, there is some, some noise cancellation.\nUh, uh, uh,\nAnd so hopefully that will work out.\nOkay, so let's get started, because we want to, uh, cut this shortest uh, uh, so yeah.\nSo we fit into the half hour and [PERSON3] is hopefully answering.\nSo, uh, my to dos.\nOr the items, that I want, to, bring up, uh, are the two sessions that we have.\nSo one is [PROJECT13] and the other is [PROJECT6].\nSo [PROJECT13] is the Holocaust survivor's session \nAnd the [PROJECT6] has been postponed by a month.\nSo that gives us, uh, some extra time, which is, uh, which is good.\nUm, I've started documents with \"to do\" lists.\nThis is is mainly on [PERSON7].\nBut I would like to ask anyone who could help.\nSo [PERSON13]  you or you said that, you would be very busy and you could-\nUh, like, is there anything you can help with or, uh, or, uh-.\n(PERSON13) I, I would not make any like false promise like, make, a, promise now, and otherwise\nnot do it.\nSo I am, I'm like I will be quite honest because I'm like slumbered with the homework, the  \nassignments and exams approaching.\nI'm on the technical calls regularly so I'm like up to date with what is like happening and who is  \ndoing what. \nSo after a month when I get time I think I can get quickly to the project <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON12) Yeah, okay.\nSo in case you had some extra time I suggest that you talk directly to [PERSON7]-.\n(PERSON13) Okay, I'm happy to do that.\n(PERSON12) And ask if there is any like one shot of thing that you could do.\nMm, it, it, could, be, any, data preparation, like, downloading for, uh, some, some, domain data  \nyou know, for the two, uh, events, or, or, something, like that.\nMm, yeah.\nI'm happy to see [PERSON14] here as well.\nUh, so [PERSON14] have you answered whether you would be available as a back-up?\nOr, uh, I haven't asked you yet?\nSorry, my fault.\n<laugh/>\nUh, I'm I'm sending a question to [PERSON14] now, so the the second event, the [PROJECT6] will have two  \nparts.\nOne will be online, pre-recorded.\nAnd that will be interleaved with a real live discussion, which will take place, in the [PROJECT6].\nAnd, I'm, going to the [PROJECT6] tomorrow.\nUhm, for like technical meeting.\nSo I will see where can we plug our bear ringers and actually record the sound, uh, um, on the, uh, \non site.\nAnd I 'm just checking if [PERSON14] would be available as a back-up person in case of whatever I get  \nsick, or something like that.\nFor that is in February.\nIt has been moved to the 26th of February.\nSo we need.\nYeah.\n(PERSON14) Yes, okay.\nI can do it.\n(PERSON12) Yes, thanks.\nSo, so I plan to do it myself.\nI plan to go there, but like, we need a back-up person.\nAnd, uh, also for the [PROJECT13] event.\nWe need someone to take care of the recording, so the archiver person.\nSo then we do not lose that session again.\nSo this is, uh, these two things.\nAnd, like, the more important and still persisting topic to to work on is the ladder climbing and  \nI've suggested here uh, in the uh, uh, in the uh, paragraph for [PERSON7], uh,\nthat we could use simple HTML tables that would be auto generated, and that would grow.\nAnd um, um, yeah, it could show that-.\nSo I think that that would be probably the easiest, uh, to just put up the tables as HTML.\nBut it could get difficult when we want to see the differences as the perform-.\nAs like the like new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.\nIt may be difficult to prepare these tables.\nSo I asked [PERSON3] and [PERSON3] unfortunately won't be available during this call.\nUm, to to tell us whether the Weights and Biases, which is a web based solution.\nSome start up company which offers, uh, accounts for academic purposes for free, if that would help \nus are or not.\nUm, yeah, okay, so Weights and Biases this is not really, uh, recommended by [PERSON3].\nAnd so so the simple HTML is probably the, uh, the way to go.\nSo as soon as [PERSON7] has these evaluations, um, cleaned up.\nSo that means moving the few scripts to, uh, where they belong from [PROJECT2] test set and some  \nautomatic runner.\nThen also, please create a conversion from the tables into HTML.\nSimilarly to the tech conversion and then put these results, uh, uh, regularly to to your webpage.\nOr what you could even do, is to have a full, uh, Git check out, uh, directly located in this  \npublic HTML or simling from that public HTML.\nSo that, um, it would be immediately accessible through the web.\nAnd anybody could could have a look at the current scoring, and and and like explore that.\nSo this, this would be useful, especially for people outside of [ORGANIZATION4] such as, [ORGANIZATION10], uhm, we  \nknow they have like-\nThe performance was was bad for some of the files and they could directly, uh, browse it on the  \nweb.\nUhm, they could also browse it actually in in on [ORGANIZATION7].\nSo if this is up to you to set it up so that it is like user friendly and and easy and easy to  \nfollow.\n(PERSON7) Okay, yeah, yeah, I'll do that.\n(PERSON12) Yeah, thanks.\nSo that is, um, myself.\nI'm now, uh, working on, uh, getting to update the, um, demo paper submission, which is due next  \nFriday, if I 'm not mistaken.\nAnd then I have some project reports to do, and I'm starting to gather documents, ah, like, or  \nlinks to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, uh, for the two sessions.\nUh so there is the standard work.\nAnd then I'm pretty busy with minuting.\nLike not not doing anything myself, but just arranging what what people do.\nSo this is my report.\nSo please, uhm then proceed one by one and tell me.\nWe have already heard from [PERSON13] probably no progress over the Christmas.\nYeah, that's that's fine like it is it is exam period.\nSo, ah, so [PERSON7].\nUh, maybe if you could summarize your impressions from the finishing of the deliverables. Like,  \nwhat is missing, and what is, um, uh, what, you, were, happy, about, and, what you were unhappy  \nabout, when doing D one point five and D six point three.\n(PERSON7) I think of the one point five, uh.\nOkay, so we are just reporting.\nI mean, we are reporting the numbers of words, so, the statistics about the transcript percent,  \nright?\nOh yeah, it is a good metric, I would say to represent the numbers.\nBut I would also say that, uh, we should also represent a language pairs.\nLike, uh,. let's say, \n(PERSON12) Mhm, yeah.\n(PERSON7) English to a German or English to Czech or vies versa, so that, um, ultimately we get, uh,  \nenough.\nOriginally we wanted to get an idea about, uh, the conversion, like the world ratio of two  \nlanguages for a given transcript.\n(PERSON12) Yeah\n(PERSON7) That would also be helpful.\nUm.\nAnd then this would probably also, uh, help us in getting.\nSo I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, uh, [PROJECT3] and we  \nwant to remove it.\nOr we had to remove the empty lines, uh, due to profanity filtering.\nSo we had to check it at the moment that, uh, whether to remove the-.\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\n(PERSON7) So far. I'm not really sure.\n(PERSON12) So what do you-.\n(PERSON7) I can't remember the word exactly.\n(PERSON12) Yeah, uh, so let me let me take a record here, so, uh, [PERSON7] will do this.\nAnd then, uh, as observations, uh, uh, of some D one point five empty, six point, uh, three  \npreparation.\nSo, uh, for, uh, uh, test set size.\nUh, info we should at a statistic per, uh, uh, language pair.\nUh, then, uh,  for what was for was the second thing-.\nYeah, yeah.\n(PERSON7) Okay, so, for-.\n(PERSON12) Uh, for for [PROJECT3] as well.\nUh, We should add, uh, to complimentary metric, uh, actually it is more.\nWe should add complementary met these complementary metric.\nUh ,so, you mentioned one, and that is profanity filtering, uh, evaluation.\nUh, so, uh, have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output, right?\n(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah.\n(PERSON12) And then, uh, then, uh, rare words evaluation.\nUh, and here have an explicit list of names and, uh, terms, uh, that we, uh, do want to appear in  \nthe output.\nUh, scored, uh, not simply by word error rate but, scored by something which directly accounts, uh, \nthese things, right?\nYes, so I I totally agree.\nUh, this involves also manual preparation of the reference, so, hm, both need manual-,\nuh, manually created references.\nI have one remark from from [PERSON9].\nSo, [PERSON2] has compiled, uh, some, uh, uh, translation dictionary, um, and, uh, uh,  \nshould-.\nShe should share it soon.\nSo this could become an [PROJECT9] part of the second thing of the railroad.\nUh, so this would be the rare, uh, words, uh, eval for [PROJECT9] and then from [PROJECT13] we are also likely  \nto get some dictionary.\nUh, so that will be [PROJECT13] domain obviously?\nAnd [PERSON7] could I ask you to to revise the [PROJECT1] domain and creates such a dictionary by looking at  \nthe outputs and what is missing in the outputs.\nSo like short listing, uh, listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the [PROJECT1] domain.\nCould you do that?\n(PERSON7) I think I still have to make a call with, uh, [PERSON10].\nSo we haven't had a call yet.\nSo probably I will have one call with him next Monday.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\nAnd then, you know, I I can also look at it.\n(PERSON7) Yeah, so you are-.\nYou are afraid you are busy.\nYou, uh, uh, probably, can 't get get to it soon.\n(PERSON7) Actually.\nNo, I mean-\nNot before Monday.\nBecause tomorrow I have my <unintelligible/> test.\n(PERSON12) Uh, so, let's, uh, well-.\nNext week, uh, consider if [PERSON7] would have the capacity to extract-.\nOr we could also ask [PERSON1], uh, not [PERSON10], but, [PERSON1], uh, uh, to extract\nuh, this positive plus negative lists from [PROJECT1] or domain documents.\nSo that would be the various [PROJECT8], uh, uh, uh, things.\n(PERSON7) Uh, there was one more thing.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON7) So basically, it has to do with the scores that we are calculating.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON7) So, uh, I think we need to improve our segmenter, the worlds are getting revised fine.\nIf, uh, we improve our segmenters our score should be higher than what we are getting.\n(PERSON12) Mhm, okay, so, uh, the, uh, segmenter or well, it is a problem.\n<laugh/>\nUm, yeah.\nIf we improve that, yeah, uh, well, it would be much better.\nOkay, uh, so uh, what I miss still, and what should belong to the ladder climbing and the regular  \nreports is [PROJECT10] style of evaluation.\nSo we will, uh, talk about this at the latest next Wednesday with partners.\nUh, whether we are happy with the way of delay is being calculated.\nSo, [PERSON7] could you get us, uh, also some of the delay scores?\nSo maybe, start with a single document.\nDo not do it for all of them yet.\nBut, uh, get in touch with [PERSON1] and get some delay scores for some of the files from the [PROJECT2]  \ntest set.\nProbably from the IW[PROJECT10] Dev set, uh, the, the, the Portuguese or whatever, uh, domain.\nSo, segmenter is related tom this a lot, so that's why <unintelligible/> it occurred to me that we  \nneed that.\nSo, uh, [PERSON7] please prepare for, uh, for the, uh, Wednesday call with, uh, like, uh, other  \npartners by, uh, getting [PROJECT10] scores delay plus [PROJECT7], uh,  on one of the IW[PROJECT10] Dev, uh, files or  \nuh other, uh, [PROJECT1] domain files.\nSo again, with the help of [PERSON1], ask him right now how to get it.\nThe plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it  \njust for one file.\nAnd and see, what what we get there?\n(PERSON7) Okay, sure.\nI'll first ask him to, uh, correct po- the current [PROJECT10]L for the correct type we have.\nSo the correct one is not working.\nI had to come almost come from the back from it.\n(PERSON12) Yeah, yeah, sure.\n(PERSON7) <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON12) Yeah, sure.\n(PERSON7) Okay.\n(PERSON12) Mhm yeah, okay.\nThank you.\nSo yeah, I should mention that loud, that like, uh, [PERSON7], has done tremendous amount of work, uh,  \nfor the deliverable.\nUh, it was towards the end of the year.\nLuckily, he doesn't celebrate Christmas.\nSo it was not a spoiled Christmas break for any, any European person.\nIt would be as spoiled Christmas.\nSo, uh, uh, they. in the end, I'm I'm happy with the tables that we put into the deliverables.\nBut this is something which I have been asking for since August already.\nSo you see, that like, it's is despite, it seems simple, it actually takes time, and we need to  \nwork this way.\nAnd I, uh, for the continuous, uh evaluation, for the ladder climbing I really do want to have tha, \nuh, uh, um, these observations being gathered like throughout the weeks and \nnot for the deadline.\nBecause, then you you see how stressful it was to to to get, uh, all the things together.\nSo, uh, so let's, uh, that is for everybody.\nLet us keep in mind that evaluation is something which takes time.\nAnd uh, uh, like the presentation of that is also important, and we need to do it way before the  \ndeadline is approaching.\nSo hopefully we will be more likely with, uh, like, time allocation for this, and and hopefully it  \nwill be less, uh, stressful. \nFor both of the sessions, [PROJECT13] and [PROJECT6] I do already want to choose the system the the  \npipeline from some choices, and this has to be based on some numbers.\nSo we haven't done that before.\nWe have always used just some of the system and and not really thought about which one, but let's  \nreally start making an informed choice.\n(PERSON7) Oh yes.\nSo, uh, [PROJECT13] is going to be in Czech, right?\nUh, yes, if I'm not mistaken.\nIt is in Czech, right?\nSo that actually-.\nYeah.\n(PERSON7) <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON12) You will need to be in touch with [PERSON10], as you said, uh, because we need to revive, uh, the  \n[PROJECT5].\nAnd [PERSON5] is trying to get [PROJECT5] running for himself as well.\nBut I 'm not sure how far he is so like, I believe.\n(PERSON5) Well, uh, I finally, I finally managed to compile it.\n(PERSON12) <laugh/>\n(PERSON5) Well it was some fix I found on the internet.\nIt was just some flag for linking.\nSo it wasn't that bad, actually.\nAnd now I 'm trying to, uh, train the a model on common voice.\nAnd I was thinking that maybe I should revise which the data set.\nI will be actually using for the for the experiment.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON5) Because of most papers, uh, actually, they are not using a common voice.\nSo maybe maybe it is better to use some other data set.\nBut on the other hand, um, benefit of the common voice is that we have additional information about \ngender and speakers.\nAnd there are also non native speakers there, many, non native speakers, mostly Indians and so on.\nSo the question is, uh, which data set we want to use, or whether we want to use more datasets.\n(PERSON12) More datasets.\nMy answers is definitely more datasets.\nSo I suggest that you choose what-.\nWell, uh, there is an email that I send already before Christmas.\nto [PERSON17] and [PERSON15] so to the [ORGANIZATION10] people asking about links to the data, and they still didn't  \nrespond.\nI sent them a reminder yesterday.\nIf you have seen that as well, so hopefully they will respond.\nAnd I suggest that you use all they suggest, all they recommend.\nAnd, uh, also common voice.\nBecause we really need to-.\nSo the the goal is to have the baseline, and then to do the, uh, uh, the word uh, cutting thing.\nUh, but I think that already this baseline should be geared towards non native speakers.\nSo that's why I'd definitely like the common voice to be in there.\nBut at the same time, I'm, I'm pretty sure the common voice alone would be too small.\nIt would not be good, uh, it would be good for comparison purposes, but it would not be good as a  \nsystem for deployment.\n(PERSON5) Okay, okay.\nYeah, yeah.\nAs for the system day, it it it is clear that when it is all the data since we have available.\nBut I was thinking rather about some paper from one that might stem from from this experiment.\nAnd for that, it might be actually better to use some, uh, more frequently used the dataset, for \nexample, [ORGANIZATION2], or maybe [ORGANIZATION3].\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\nSo, uh, whatever you can get easily and easily converted to the appropriate format.\nPlease combine all that together.\nAnd, uh, so when I said that [PERSON8] is owing us the list of [PROJECT4] data and other links, they actually  \nhave already provided these, uh, links in some way.\nUh, uh, to deliverables in the work package one.\nSo, uh, these references are already available to some extent.\nAnd and now I do not know which is if it is D one point-.\nUh, let me check [PROJECT2]\nYou, deliverables, D one one and D one five.\nSo, D one one and D one five.\nSo, uh, the one one is, uh, publicly available.\nD one five.\nI'm sure you have that in your overleaf [PERSON5].\n(PERSON5) Where can I find it, exactly?\n(PERSON12) So I have-\n(PERSON5) So I have overleaf open.\nSo it's-.\nSo which document it is.\n(PERSON12) So I 'm now, I'm now in the the search organization document.\nThe one where we had the link.\nUh, uh, for this call.\n(PERSON5) Okay, I will open it.\n(PERSON12) D one five.\n(PERSON5) D six three.\n(PERSON12) No, D one five.\nSo I 've just pasted the link, uh, to the [ORGANIZATION11] doc as well.\nSo D one five is this one, yah, and D one one is is already published.\nSo please browse these, there is an [PROJECT3] section.\nAnd you are the one.\nYou are actually the only one who is training [PROJECT3] system, uh, at [ORGANIZATION4] these days.\nSo you should, uh, like clean or make yourself familiar with the data on our disks and put it  \nthere. \nSo net data, and not necessarily within [PROJECT2].\nIt can be also outside of [PROJECT2] it can be like you have the directory.\nYou know, the directory where to where to put these things.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nIn the [PROJECT2] data.\n(PERSON12) Yah, okay.\n(PERSON13) Sorry to interrupt.\nI I was also thinking I would like to get in touch.\nI <unintelligible/> to work with [PERSON5] on [PROJECT5] [PROJECT3] actually.\nUh, I'm also thinking to do some non native speech, uh-.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON13) Uh, like, in building a non native speech, uh, automated system, for tor some languages, as a  \npart of my, as a part of the masters thesis.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON13) So I mean, I think the sooner I get started working on it the sooner I will be able to I, I  \nwill be able to build the-\nUh, I I do not know, because I haven't done this in the past.\nSo-\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\nSo is there still any benefit in uh talking to [PERSON10] for the two of you [PERSON13] and [PERSON5]?\nBecause [PERSON7] will have a call with [PERSON10].\nSo should you join that as well?\nSo that you, like, [PERSON10] has already written, like, understood some of the traces that [PERSON11] left  \nfor us.\nSo he was able to run the system, at least.\nAnd now [PERSON10] has left.\nSo we need , we need to make sure it is stored.\nThat the knowledge is stored with someone in the team, it can be [PERSON7], but it also could be  \n[PERSON13] and [PERSON5].\n(PERSON13) So, what I was thinking, that I should first view the video which [PERSON11] had, \nrecorded, before he left.\nSo, once, uh, once, I, I, I, go through that, then I think, uh, me a [PERSON5] can decide on when to  \nhave a call, uh, with [PERSON10].\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\nI'm two part of the of the video, or from the beginning.\nAnd um, I-\nIf I'm not mistaken that some of the paths are not existing yet.\nSo, some things were removed, so I don't know whether we can run everything which is in in the  \nvideo.\n<other_noise/>\nSo maybe it it will be better for us to to attend the call with the [PERSON10].\nSo then we are with the most up-to-date version of our remote <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON13) Yeah, said the sounds.\nThat, that actually sounds best <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON5) And then we can-.\nAnd then we can have call together.\nSo because I m actually also like to work on the non native speakers so of it is actually, uh, uh,  \none part of my, uh, uh, of my thesis.\nSo.\nUh, but if I understand it correctly you you would like to do this model using [PROJECT5]  \n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON13) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, okay.\nBecause that would be great because I 'm more fan of the of the, you know, \n<unintelligible/> models.\nSo we can actually compare its performance.\nSo that would be great to cooperate on this thing.\n(PERSON13) Yeah, probably that would also uh, ease the distribution of [PROJECT2] project.\n(PERSON5) Okay, so uh, the call with, [PERSON10], uh, should continue right after this call.\n(PERSON12)  So, [PERSON7], when is your call.\n(PERSON7) No, I will probably talk to him on Monday.\nThat is why I'll drop send him an email today.\nBut [PERSON10] is busy <unintelligible/> and not available on Friday, so it will be probably on Monday or  \nTuesday.\n(PERSON5) Okay, uh, [PERSON7].\nSo, uh, so please include me with the mail so I can add it to my calendar.\nYeah sure, I'll I'll do and [PERSON13].\nAnd probably [PERSON13], [PERSON13].\n(PERSON7) Yeah.\n(PERSON12)  Great, okay.\nGreat, so I'm happy that we have not missed this.\nUh, this opportunity for sunchro-, uh, for a synch.\nOkay, uh, thanks.\nSo let's quickly move to [PERSON14].\nUh, unless there is anything very important [PERSON5] uh still needs to say.\nUh, no, no, I think I don't have anything.\n(PERSON7) Yeah, about the call with [PERSON10].\nActually I wanna ask, so, uh, when do you finalise for the replacement for [PERSON10].\n<unintelligible/> so me, the others and [PERSON13] already know-.\nOr if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that \nessentially he will also be training [PROJECT3] systems if he is to replace [PERSON10].\n(PERSON12) Uh, uh, yes, you're talking about the what is his name.\nSorry, I have missed that.\n(PERSON7) Uh, uh, [PERSON4].\n(PERSON12) Vi-, [PERSON4].\n(PERSON7) There was-\n Yes.\n(PERSON12) Vi, [PERSON4], yeah, yeah, yeah.\nI I  I need to, uh, respond to that.\nThat's my fault, it's on my \" to do\" list.\n(PERSON7) Okay, thanks.\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\nOkay, thanks.\nAnd [PERSON14], you have the summary.\nSo please present it.\n(PERSON14) Yes.\n(PERSON12) And you are just missing one more thing.\nAnd that is the language, oh yes, it's there, yes.\n(PERSON14) It's there.\nSo before Christmas, I released the [PROJECT11] corpus for [PERSON3].\nAnd this, uh, this week, I implemented or or trained speech language identification.\nI have a model for Czech, German and English which kind of works on YouTube videos in Euro  \nparliament.\nAnd I tried on [PERSON6] speaking her German accented English, and it worked.\nIt in works in online mode, with three seconds delay, and I 'm going to integrate it into the  \nmediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it.\nAnd then I'm going to pass it to [PERSON13] or anyone who can train other model the same way as me.\nBecause maybe we need five languages of [ORGANIZATION9] or anything else.\nAnd then I'm going to analyze the ASI dev <unintelligible/> data and then probably [PROJECT12]  \ntraining or anything else.\n(PERSON12) That, the [PROJECT12] that will be with [PERSON3].\nAnd one topic is missing.\nAnd that is the, uh, study.\nSubtitler study where we are aiming for the end of the month deadline, right?\nAre we?\n(PERSON14) Yes, probably.\n(PERSON12) It should be doable.\nSo let's.\nLet's give it a try, it.\nIt would be like.\nIt would be great if we managed to to do that.\nSo I will write it down.\nSo um, aiming, uh, towards [ORGANIZATION8] deadline with a subtitler study paper, uh, yes, uh, and then, uh,  \nthen [PROJECT12]. \nUh, with [PERSON3] or based upon [PERSON3].\nAnd for the language ID I'm curious, how do you want to integrate it exactly.\nBecause it already involves considering multiple [PROJECT3] sources, multiple channels.\nSo, uh, what would be the use case for, uh, for the language idea.\nHow do we plug that in?\nDo we plug it as-.\n(PERSON14) It will, it will be as audio to text worker-\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON14) And it will emit time stamps like -.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON14) For for a two second window.\nAnd and and class, you can see the silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the  \nothers how they want to use it, in, the, pipeline.\n(PERSON12) That, is, that, is important.\nPlease write this down here in the document, this briefing summary.\nUh, because, uh, that is, uh, [PERSON7], and also [PERSON7], when you talk to [PERSON16] a well and also  \npossibly [PERSON13].\nUh, if we have this tool, we need to ship the audio, uh, to multiple, um, uh, [PROJECT3], uh, or,  \nmultiple, uh, workers, in, the, directory. <other_noise/>\nWe will separately need to ship the audio to the English [PROJECT3] separately.\n<other_noise/>,\nTo the German [PROJECT3] and the Czech [PROJECT3] for example.\n<other_noise/>\nDepending on the <unintelligible/>.\n<other_noise/>\nAnd also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs.\n<other_noise/>\nAnd this is the tool which we do not have yet.\nThat's the [PROJECT12] tool, which will be preserving these text outputs and also following the  \ntime stamps <other_noise/>.\nUh, and it would emit, uh, it would probably like <other_noise/> produce <other_noise/> \nuh, separate the output into the three language channels.\nProducing either silent or correct [PROJECT3].\n<other_noise/>\nSo we need like, uh, filters for the [PROJECT3]s so the [PROJECT3] is silent if' it's the wrong language and it,  \nuh, it, it is the recognized text if it is the correct language.\nSo we need to figure out.\nSo this is just one-.\nLike I just made it up, this this type of set-up.\nAnother set up would be that, the same sound is shipped to [PROJECT3] and this language checker and, uh,  \nthat already, like this language checker is essentially a a part of the [PROJECT3] silencing the [PROJECT3] if it \nis the wrong language.\nThat is also an an option.\nSo, we need to figure out, which way, um, uh, is of integrating the language ID \nis the best for our purposes.\nSo, please keep thinking about, uh, this, uh, like what are our pipelines.\nIdeally, uh, uh, I think that uh, the, the, least, uh, like, management, \nconfusion, and, and, so on would arise if our [PROJECT9] models were multilingual.\nIf it supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages  \ninto English.\nPossibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input.\nAh, so, we would have this multi langue- multilingual, multiple [PROJECT3] at the beginning all going into \nEnglish and then from the English would go into all of the languages.\nAnd later, when [PERSON5] would have a multilingual model of [PROJECT3], uh, that language ID would not even  \nbe needed.\n<other_noise/>\nSo this is,uh, like, we, need to, uh, figure out, uh.\n<other_noise/>\n<unintelligible/> building blocks.\nYeah, so.\nSo, like, please think about if, uh, for a while.\nYou have seen the sessions, you know what can happen.\nUh, and, uh, I think that we should have multi lingual, uh, [PROJECT9] models and either multi lingual [PROJECT3]  \nor multiple [PROJECT3] with this language ID all feeding into the same multi lingual [PROJECT9] and then this [PROJECT9]  \nproducing English.\nAnd then from English, will go to all the, uh, of the other languages.\nDoes that make sense?\n(PERSON7) Um, I mean it kind of does, but it will like <unintelligible/> bias the translations.\nSo-.\n<other_noise/>\nI mean, the quality is probably going to the deteriorate.\n<other_noise/>\nGiven the time <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON12) Yeah, not necessary for the for the multilingual models.\nIt's a, it's, um-.\nIf it is a [PROJECT12]-\nUh, it is should-.\nLike it's.\nUh, it is not.\nIt's not [PROJECT12], uh, by having multiple concurrent inputs.\nIt's multi, just, multilingual.\nUh, I don't think, it, should deteriorate too much if it's if it's, uh, three languages, uh, at  \nthe, uh at the beginning.\nAnd we don't have-.\n(PERSON7) I think-\nIf I think [ORGANIZATION11] or [ORGANIZATION1] has done something like this.\nAnd they do not have an intermediate language.\nSo it is direct from one language to another.\nInitially it was from the initial language to English and then to another language.\nBut now they have another tool, which is essentially from one language to another language.\nIt doesn't involve getting english in between.\nAnd, uh, it proved to be more efficient than, uh, putting English in between.\nSo, English, as the intermediatory language.\nSo, uh, I mean to interpret -\nOr they talked about how the computer had learned to try, or to interprete- \nOr it created one language on it's own.\nStarter <unintelligible/>\n<other_noise/>\nSo I understand too.\nIt was early German and Spanish.\n(PERSON12) Mhm.\n(PERSON7) So the machine was translating Spanish to something which only it \nknows and no one else.\nAnd there was converting it to German.\nSo there was them.\nThey were obviously a intermediate language, but that language was not, uh, manually annotated.\nSo, uh, it is someone who knows, uh, Czech.\nAnd no, who knows Spanish and, uh, German both.\nSo, he or she can directly translate from one language to another, withour using English as a  \nderivatory language.\n(PERSON12) Well, if if you could find a reference to, this.\nPlease, uh, let me know.\nBut, uh, so far what you said, it seems to me, it is like, uh, the general statement. \nThat direct bilingual models are better, uh, than models, uh, than, output, that are \npivoted.\nAnd I do not think that, this, is, uh, an, ultimately, uh, true statement.\nI think it very much depends on the data available.\nIf you have good data for the language pair, then yes, it is better to go directly.\nBut if your data is more available through English then it's it's better to go through English or  \nsynthetise the uh the data for the direct language pair.\nAnd that's probably the best quality you can get.\nThat you create synthetic corpora, uh, based on English centric data set but you create then a  \ndirect model.\n(PERSON7) Uh, so, it it was not necessarily a bilingual, it it was a multi lingual model.\n(PERSON12) It was multi lingual.\nYeah.\n(PERSON7) Yeah, the input could be multi lingual as well as the output would be multi lingual.\nSo I mean that's why it was interesting.\n(PERSON12) Yeah.\n(PERSON7) I will try to find it and send it to you.\n(PERSON12) Yeah, okay, thank you.\nUh, so thanks, uh, [PERSON14], for, uh, the write up.\nYes, the the book, uh, we definitely have to have it out, in uh uh.\nIn, the middle of the year so, uh, probably we should start meeting on that and start, uh, writing, \nuh, right after the subtitler study is, is a way.\n(PERSON14) Yes, sure.\n(PERSON12) Okay.\nSo I think that is it for the call today.\nI'll try to record somewhat my suggestion about how to use the language ID in theirs that we have  \nin the document, and otherwise, uh, uh, uh, uh, have a good week and talk to you, uh, next, uh,  \nThursday, and be in touch, uh, with, uh, the preparations for the for the events so that is, uh and \nthe continuous evaluation.\nThat is the, the ladder climbing is the most urgent thing now.\nOkay, so thanks a lot.\nThank you.\n(PERSON7) Thank you.\nBye.\n(PERSON13) Bye bye.\n(PERSON14) Bye.\n", "utterances":

The term \"ladder climbing\" refers to the continuous evaluation and improvement process of speech-to-text (STT) systems. In the context of the meeting, it was mentioned as a topic that requires attention and work.\n\nLadder climbing involves iteratively training and refining STT models over time to enhance their performance. This is achieved by conducting evaluation campaigns and benchmarking the systems against various metrics. The goal is to identify areas where the system's performance can be improved and make incremental adjustments or updates to achieve better accuracy, efficiency, or other desired qualities.\n\nThe ladder climbing process typically involves collecting data, performing evaluations, analyzing the results, and making necessary modifications to the STT models or their underlying components. It aims to gradually climb the metaphorical \"ladder\" of system performance, taking steps towards achieving higher accuracy and quality in speech recognition.\n\nIn the meeting, there was a mention of creating tables, using HTML or other formats, to present the results of the ladder climbing process for easier monitoring and comparison of system performance.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the concept of ladder climbing in the context of the meeting.
