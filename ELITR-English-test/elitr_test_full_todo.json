These segmentation methods are used to determine the boundaries for calculating delay and estimate the expected time for each word in the context of the evaluation framework. \n\nTime-based segmentation involves dividing the audio into segments based on time intervals. For example, a window of four to eight seconds may be used, and the most probable pause between words is identified within that window.\n\nWord-based segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting the audio based on the pauses between words. The goal is to identify and separate individual words in order to analyze and measure the delay between them.\n\nBoth types of segmentation help in assessing and evaluating the performance of the system in terms of timing and delays."
