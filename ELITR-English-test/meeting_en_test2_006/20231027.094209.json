<unintelligible/>\nHello.\n(PERSON7) Hello.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, sorry, for the delay and sorry for the complications.\nI had a [ORGANIZATION12] call\u00a0 this morning with this cell phone, and it worked.\nEeeh and I don\u00b4t know, why it doesn\u00b4t work at the moment.\nEh -\nI\u00b4m on - eh\n<another_language/>\nYeah, sorry.\nSo I\u00b4m I\u00b4m I\u00b4m back.\nIt\u00b4s -\nThe kids have taken all my eh, all my computers and I left with eh, with the cellphone only.\nEh, so I can not share the the the [ORGANIZATION2] doc eh, eh -\nBut -\nWell, I hope that everybody's looking at the [ORGANIZATION2] doc.\nAnd thanks to all who joined, um, so to explain to especially [PERSON15]and [PERSON10] who didn\u00b4t -\nAnd maybe [PERSON7], eh, who didn\u00b4t have the experience with these calls last eh s- summer.\nUh.\nThe goal is to synchronize the group, and the date and time eh, the so the day and time of the week is chosen, uh, so that it is fits to most of us.\nEh, and we if we see that the uh, the the participation is is eh, falling down, because people\u00b4s schedules changed.\nThen we will run, or we will update that call again and we\u00b4ll choose maybe a different slot.\nAnd eh, those who cannot attend eh, for a particular week, that\u00b4s not a problem at all.\nLike if if randomly you can not attend, no worries, eh, instead of excusing yourself just enter your details in the shared document before the call.\nAnd that\u00b4s it.\nThat serves as an excuse already.\nEh, so, eh, otherwise these calls are very important, especially to reconnect with people eh, that, eh ere somewhat eh, like stranded alone for a longer while.\nSo one of those is [PERSON11], for example, eh, so eh I would later ask [PERSON11] to eh, to to give us a brief summary of what he he has been working on for the past months actually.And what he is is he up to.And eh, there will be a lot of connection with eh, lot of connections with everything what he do.\nAnd one more eh, comment from myself.\nEh, this call is being recorded, I hope you don\u00b4t mind.\nUh, and eh, we are eh, hoping that that will be allowed by you have to use these calls for the meeting summarization eh, eh, so eh, the - \nFe- if you agree now, like please keep participating in the call, and the consent that you are giving by your participation now is not to publish the data yet.\nIt\u00b4s only consent to process the data within the team.\nSo we will be processing the data.\nWe\u00b4ll be anonymizing these calls, so we\u00b4ll be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholders and so.\nAnd then once the data is anonymized or pseudonymized so, it\u00b4s like full anonymization is actually not possible.\nBecause you could be always identified by your background.\nBut eh, eh, but the text will not contain any clear links to you.\nSo it would be eh, pseudonymized.\nAfter this we\u00b4ll ask you again eh, to give us a permission to uh, to use this in the uh, for the sum- meeting summarization purposes.\nEh, so -\nYeah. \nThat that\u00b4s about recording.\nAnd and the uh, the the warning that I have to say before we go into the individual ehm, individual report is that eh, there is the [ORGANIZATION7] conference.\nEh, I think it\u00b4s early December.\nSo less than month from now, and we should eh, get ready for that, because eh,\u00a0this [ORGANIZATION7] conference will serve as a test eh, event for us.\nEh, we should be as prepared as we would be for the main [ORGANIZATION16] Congress.\nEh, and this year we have eh, asked [ORGANIZATION7] to only allow us to connect to their -\nI think it would be [ORGANIZATION12] eh, oh, eh <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION12] to only connect and show the the subtitle somewhere on the side, quite silently without much publicity.\nAnd if the [ORGANIZATION16] Congress is actually not happening.\nThen we will use the next year's [ORGANIZATION7] as our main eh, demo event for for the [PROJECT5] project.\nSo it is an important exercise.\nIt will be with limited or no audience this year, probably.\nUh, but it\u00b4s at least like sympathetic audience.\nI\u00b4s all MLT researchers.\nSo they will understand what what are the problems of the technology.\nBut we need to get ready for that, because it\u00b4s is a serious demo.\nSo ehm, so eh, well w- we\u00b4ll be working -\nEveryone of you will be working somehow to uh, to help with this as you are working that anyway.\nEh, okay, so that\u00b4s enough from me.\nEh, and I would like now eh, I would like to ask [PERSON11] now to start, because he has been the most eh, eh remote\u00a0 for a while.\n(PERSON11) Hm, hello.\nCan you hear me, see me?\n(PERSON3) Yes.\nYes, I don\u00b4t see you <unintelligible/>, but -\n(PERSON11) Okay.\nEeeh.\n(PERSON14) I could see you.\n(PERSON3) That\u00b4s a problem.\n(PERSON11) Yes, so -\nActually I don\u00b4t know what was the last time when I was eh, on this call.\nBut so eh -\nThe first thing actually that that I have been working since on this calls was the paraphrasing. \nWhich is that I I was using the rainbow model for for paraphrasing for, for [PERSON1].\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON11) Eh, and the- then since then I haven\u00b4t actually been working on so much.\nBut there have been some things since I didn\u00b4t have really uh, so many instructions.\nSo one thing that that, I have been working on is, uh, is actually actually trying to collect the data that we can use -\nThe monoli- monolingual data tha- that we can use eh, for for this rainbow models.\nAnd for this I have actually found -\nI have I have a -\nBecause like the problem is that that we need the domain specific data and -\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\n(PERSON11) I have -\nSo, I have been thinking that that well -\nEh, so so so at first, I tried eh, actually filtering eh, so- some some other data sets that already exists.\nSuch as -\nSuch as common crawl and so on.\nBut I found that that it is actually quite a problem to to find spoken data there.\nSince it\u00b4s - \nUsually web pages.\nSo, so what I thought is that I would eeh -\nI would go over some, eh, some more pages, wer- where there are actually some videos, and to download transcripts from there.\nAnd so for this, I tried eh, to go to [ORGANIZATION10].\nAnd I actually di- discovered that that you can scrape eh, subtitles from from these these, uh, courses,\nEh, w- which are actually in eh, like multiple languages.\nSo so so -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON11) So this way I I obtained eh -\nYes, so so in the free version there are some limitations.\nSo I only obtained to scrape a small data set like one hundred thousand sentences, which could like be used for testing.\nBut still, it\u00b4s something and and and otherwise I I didn\u00b4t find out any -\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\n(PERSON11) Any other ideas so -\nSo any s- any suggestions would wo- would be welcome.\n(PERSON3) The [ORGANIZATION6].\n[ORGANIZATION6]corpus.\n(PERSON11) Yeah.\n(PERSON3) So yo- are you in touch with [PERSON13]?\n(PERSON11) Yes, so eh, so I received the e- mail from him.\nAnd I didn\u00b4t look at it yet.\nEeeh.\n(PERSON3) Aha.\nPlease do it.\n<laugh/>\nSo -\nSo yes.\n(PERSON11) Yeah.\nSo this would be an <unintelligible/> parallel corpus.\nYes, so -\nYes, so I have to get in touch with him.\nBut I had a a lot of to do to do in in the past week.\nSo I kind of didn\u00b4t eh -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON11) Didn\u00b4t\u00a0continue with this.\nSo I I will write to him as soon as possible.\nAnd also what I have actually discovered is that [ORGANIZATION2] -\nIt\u00b4s not [ORGANIZATION2] sorry, [ORGANIZATION15].\n(PERSON3) [ORGANIZATION15].\n(PERSON11) Actually -\n(PERSON3) They release some data.\n(PERSON11) They released a data and a model.\nSo so what they released is eh -\nSo first what they released is actually an algorithm for mining parallel data in one hundred l- languages.\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\n(PERSON11) Not English-centric.\nBut actually between all of those uh, English languages.\nAnd only I don\u00b4t know one third of it is English-centric.\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\n(PERSON11) So I I have been looking at this, and they they have also released -\nBasically they haven\u00b4t released the data yet, I think, but they have also released the the trained models.\nAnd I have I have been evaluating that trained models on our testing data.\n(PERSON3) Mhm\n(PERSON11) And the the models are really huge.\nIt\u00b4s like sixteen billion parameters.\n(PERSON3) Uhm hm-\n(PERSON11) But actually, actually, I have discovered that on some, uh, on some of our testing data sets from [PROJECT6].\nThey are actually not much better than -\nEven not better than than the best Edinburgh model.\nProbably probably because they didn\u00b4t train on o- o- on spoken data.\nA- and also like like they they are very tricky to run, because you need like for GPUs with sixteen gigabytes of RAM at least.\nAnd it takes like up to a minutes to translate just one hundred sentences.\nSo for us they are quite useless and\u00a0 -\nWhat would pro- probably be the most useful is is actually the data.\nSo that we can eh, use it to to -\nSo can you -\nSo that we can adapt adapt their data collection, eh, for for some kind of spoken data.\nOtherwise it didn\u00b4t really wo- works works so much better.\nWhich quite quite suprised me.\nBut but maybe eh, on on testing data in in other low research languages it will be better.\nI\u00a0 don\u00b4t know, just -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nCan you hear me it?\n(PERSON11) Yes.\n(PERSON3) Does it work at all?\nEh, yes.\nYou can hear me right.\nSo this is eh,\u00a0that is a long report and lot of work planned and lot of work done.\nSo the evaluation -\nSo I would like to highlight the the high level thing, eh -\nSo we need monolingual data for eh, domain adaptation.\nSo in the domain to create synthetic data, based on that, we need parallel data as much as possible.\nAnd there please get in touch, and really continue and finish the [ORGANIZATION6]corpus that was started -\n(PERSON11) Uhm hm.\n(PERSON3) [PERSON13] last year already, and we never got to finish that.\nAnd these huge models, that\u00b4s excellent.\nEh, the idea that I have there is that we could use them for eh, teacher- student.\nEh, so we could distill smaller model from that.\n(PERSON11) Uhm, yeah.\n(PERSON3) So that -\n(PERSON11) This could totally work.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, so that is something that we should,eh, we should consider this like next the possible thing to do.\n(PERSON11) Uhm hm.\n(PERSON3) And the evaluation is more important.\nSo with the evaluation I would like you to em, test the evaluation eh, using [PROJECT5] test set and [PROJECT3] and in on the call I saw -\nNow it doesn\u00b4t really work for me the [ORGANIZATION12] is kind of stuck.\nBut we have [PERSON8] here eh, and he is overseeing the development of the [PROJECT3].\nAnd eh, we have eh, so-\nWho is now responsible most for eh for the [PROJECT5] test set.\nIt used to be [PERSON9], but eh, he is giving that to -\nIs that you [PERSON15], is that you?\nOr are we kind of eh, in in a post phase with the [PROJECT5]test set.\n(PERSON15) I don\u00b4t know.\n(PERSON3) You\u00b4re not on that.\nOkay.\nSo that is kind of in the eh, in like like hanging in the air.\nBecause [PERSON9] is moving more towards system integration.\nAnd eh, [PERSON6] who has worked on the [PROJECT5]test set will join us only from December.\nEh will rejoin us.\nBecause he is busy with other things.\nEeh, but the [PROJECT5] test set is there and eeh, s- so maybe if eh, [PERSON8] can briefly summarize the status of the [PROJECT2].\nAnd the connection to [PROJECT5] test set.\n(PERSON11) And maybe if someone could send me the -\n<parallel_talk/>\n<cough/>\nActually the status of\u00a0 of the test set or some links or something.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah.\n(PERSON8) Ok, so hi everbody.\nAbout [PROJECT2] [PROJECT5] test set.\nEh, I think the current version of -\nFirst of all [PERSON12] wanted to attend the call but he had problem with [ORGANIZATION5] so he wrote his report there.\nAnd I will speak on behalf of him also.\nThere -\nSo the [PROJECT5] eh, the [PROJECT2] is completely finished.\nAnd as I said you [PERSON3], it\u00b4s now workig wi -\nFor example, it\u00b4s working eh with alignment by -\nI mean <unintelligible/> if they are inside in [PROJECT5] test set.\n(PERSON3) Mhm, okay.\n(PERSON8) And we created one eh, index, new index, if you see, I put the name of the next inside the call, inside the, you know, [ORGANIZATION2] doc.\nEh, I think front of my name I wrote if I remember.\nOkay so if you see, we created a new index.\nThe name is [ORGANIZATION6] for [PROJECT2].\nAnd also only that files are created in another documents.\nIt\u00b4s eh, independent from the others.\nSo I commited it in the [PROJECT5] test set.\nAnd just I wanted to wanted to ask you, if you have just you know free time, for around one hour.\nWe can run [PROJECT2] on data and see the result and eh, you know, make the final agreement if you want to do some minor changes.\nI can do it.\nAnd then it\u00b4s ready and we can you know publish it.\n(PERSON3) Deploy -\nPublish it, yeah.\nSo the -\nYeah, so the -\nFor everybody, the general idea behind this [PROJECT5] test set and [PROJECT2] is that we would like to make it the standard evaluation tool.\nNot just for us, and not just for the [PROJECT5] project, but also for others doing a spoken language translation.\nAnd the [PROJECT5] test set contains the input texts and references and also input sounds and reference transcripts.\nEh th- so eh, well look up that [ORGANIZATION9] hub repository and eh, [PROJECT2] eh is the tool, which uses eh -\nIt can use any other inputs and references eh, but it is also directly capable capable downloading what eh, files you want to evaluate on from [PROJECT5] test set.\nSimilarly [ORGANIZATION17] eh, is is like now the standard for WMT evaluation of Blair and other scores.\nSo we would like to do this for eh, the spoken language translation eh, and also including machine translation, because its broader domain.\nEh, broader range of domains than what the S-, eh what the [ORGANIZATION17] has.\nSo everybody who is evaluating something and that is [PERSON11] with the [ORGANIZATION15] models [PERSON11] with eh, your previous eh, multilingual models, um, uh.\nThen [PERSON4] with his\u00a0 multilingual model that he is going to develop.\nThen [PROJECT5] with all the the pipeline.\nAnd I'm happy also to see Sa- [PERSON14] here on the on the call.\nSo [PERSON14] can help with that eh, to -\nSo [PERSON10] and [PERSON14] to evaluate all the workers that are in the [PROJECT5] pipeline.\nAll that should go through [PROJECT5] eh, be evaluated through [PROJECT5] eh, test set using [PROJECT2].\nSo please, everybody get in touch with [PERSON8] directly, and get it s-\nLike eh, like find a way in which this tool will work for all of you.\nEh and the mhm eh, so -\nNow we\u00b4re doing this like stress test within the consortium.\nAnd what [PERSON8] was talking about that is the plan to publish it finally at eh, at a conference.\nSo we have already sent it once.\nAnd it was eh, like not quite finished.\nAnd we sent it for the second time, and it is also not quite finished.\nSo uh, we have uh, another chance in January as a demo paper.\nUh, so for that, we would really like to have it eh, very nicely commented in a paper.\nEh, documented in a paper, and we also want to include some real evaluation in that paper to show that it is useful.\nAnd eh, [PERSON8] for this moment, selected the [ORGANIZATION6] eh, data.\nAh, so that would be like the test case of the evaluation for the purposes of the publication of the [PROJECT2].\nBut if any of your, uh, evaluations would uh, would be like more interesting than we could switch to this other use case, so that\u00b4s -\nIn any case this is a a big request from me.\nEverybody who are eh, evaluating any systems, please make sure to evaluate them using [PROJECT2] on [PROJECT5]test set.\nThere will be bugs.\nThere will be like strange results.\nBut this is exactly what we want to go through.\nWe want to fix these bugs and we want to eh, get numbers and repeated measurements so that the number stabilize, and we and we trust that.\nAnd also [PERSON5] -\nSo you could also evaluate your [PROJECT4] systems on [PROJECT2].\n(PERSON8) Yes, it\u00b4s possible, because it\u00b4s set as\u00a0[PROJECT4], but [PERSON3],in the current version, because I disabled there you know what\u00b4s the name\u00a0 -\nEh, it works off-line.\nBut only with the files inside the [PROJECT5] test set.\n(PERSON3) Yes\n(PERSON8) But you -\nOkay, but you you want the previous version also, because you said in your you know when we were talking - \nYou said when you were talking you said: It works independently, without any <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON3) Yes.\n(PERSON8) Do you prefer to have both of them?\n(PERSON3) Eh, so I think it should be the same tool, and it should try to connect to the [ORGANIZATION5]and download it.\nDownload the [PROJECT5] test set when you ask for that.\nSo it should be -\n(PERSON8) When we ask for theth.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON8) Okay.\nIt\u00b4s the same way -\n(PERSON3) It\u00b4s a same way as [ORGANIZATION17].\n[ORGANIZATION17] also works like independently or you can ask it to provide -\n(PERSON8) Okay.\n<unintelligible/> small changes.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON8) Okay, I see.\nOkay, so the the main question.\nCould you please check -\nBecause I arrived and I\u00b4m in Czech and I\u00b4m working on my things.\nBut whenever you have time, I prefer to talk with you around half an hour to an hour to finalize it.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, okay.\n(PERSON8) I prefer next week is very -\nTo- today I I 'm\u00a0 co- I'm coming to university.\nI I will come [ORGANIZATION3], I will if you are in [ORGANIZATION3] - I will go to [ORGANIZATION3].\nBut eh, I think next week is very suitable for me, whenever you have time -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nNext week will be better.\n(PERSON8) Yes.\n(PERSON3) for me as well.\n(PERSON8) Okay, so let me -\n(PERSON3) Yeah, great.\n(PERSON8) Eh, okay.\nAnd about the paper also as you remember I put some fears there and I\u00b4m waiting\u00a0 for your feedback.\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\nYeah, okay, thank you.\n(PERSON8) I thank you -\nOkay.\nSo maybe next week, when, we see we can finalize everything\n(PERSON3) Yeah, okay.\nGreat.\nYeah.\nSo now, there is eh many of you and we have only eight minutes left\u00a0 -\n(PERSON8) Okay.\n(PERSON3) I would really like to keep these calls short.\nSo who is the most lost?\nPlease\u00a0 <laugh/> Who who doesn\u00b4t know what to work on.\nWho is most like who feels most disconnected from the eh, from the goal of -\nYeah.\n(PERSON14) Yes, so I\u00b4m like completely lost here, because o- one of my lectures is scheduled so I\u00b4m attending lecture\u00a0as well as the the meeting.\nSo I have been looking here and there.\nQuite many times.\nSo -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON14) So yeah.\nAt the moment I don\u00b4t know what I should work on, and eh, who -\nWith whom I should eh, maybe -\u00a0\n(PERSON3) Yeah, so -\n(PERSON14) Work with\nSo yeah -\nI I\u00b4d be really happy if you just -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nSo please talk directly to [PERSON10], and help [PERSON10] with all what what he is lost in.\nAnd the most urgent thing to do is getting the evaluation of the of all the systems, of all the components\u00a0from the eh, mediator, all the connected workers, running through [PROJECT5] test set.\nSo we need this this cruise control.\nThe true regular evaluation of all the systems.\nThis is the most urgent thing.\nUh, and this is what what [PERSON10]is now also working on.\n(PERSON14) Oh, okay.\n(PERSON3) So please talk -\nYou you don\u00b4t have to -\nSo eh, that\u00b4s like this these conflicts with like regular lectures eh, eh, let\u00b4s eh -\nYour lecture has a p- has a priority higher priority than this call.\nSo ehm, ehm, like\u00a0we will try to accommodate to that eh, by maybe js- a- searching for new slot later on.\nOr simply having you represented only through your notes.\nSo it\u00b4not eh, eh -\nI don\u00b4t want you to skip any of your school duties and that implies to everybody of course.\n(PERSON14) Yes..\nUhm -\n(PERSON3) So please get in touch with [PERSON10] separately -\n(PERSON14) <parallel_talk/>\nYeah, okay.\n(PERSON3) And eh, the urgent most thing indeed -\n(PERSON14) Just -\nYeah.\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\nEbrahim, okay?\n(PERSON14) I\u00b4m sorry because just [PERSON12] asked me to ask you about the censorship pipeline and because he is waiting for it-\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\nYes, yes.\n(PERSON8) And if you if you have any answer for him I can tell him or you you can send e-mail about it later.\n(PERSON3) Yes.\nSo that\u00b4s that\u00b4s another topic that is very much linked toward eh -\n[PERSON4] is like uh, putting together, and also what eh, eh what [PERSON9] would be kind of doing.\nBut eh, eh, the censorship component is something which we want to have as a one part of the pipeline after the [PROJECT4].\nAnd also another one, after the machine translation.\nAnd the goal of this censorship tool is to allow to immediately hide the outputs and then show them again.\nSo there has to be some hidden user interface in which the eh, the operator of the system\u00a0 checks what are the current outputs.\nAnd he re-enables those or he can also manually switch it off, when the automatic eh, trigger didn\u00b4t fire.\nWhen when it didn\u00b4 t see anything bad, but there was something bad.\nSo it\u00b4s like -\nIt\u00b4s not really editing of the life outputs, it\u00b4s just disabling of the outputs eh, for a moment.\nAnd um, uh so -\nI thing that the best eh, sorry because as you see, I'm unable to respond in time.\nSo the best thing would be if if [PERSON12], [PERSON14], [PERSON10]and perhaps [PERSON15] as well had a separate technical call on the design of this.\nand that [PERSON12] implemented that tool, right?\n(PERSON8) It\u00b4s good.\nI think it\u00b4s the best idea.\nSo if San- [PERSON14]could you hear me?\n(PERSON14) Yeah.\nI can hear you.\n(PERSON8) Okay, so if it is possible please contact [PERSON12] and ask him for this call and if you want I can also attend the the call to -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON8) just and for example to -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nAnd and from the management point of view, [PERSON14] and [PERSON10] should be the two kind of replaceable persons.\nBecause [PERSON10] is taking over what [PERSON14] did.\n[PERSON14] has limited capacity.\nSo [PERSON10] and [PERSON14] are technically the same person there.\nThey just are-\n(PERSON8) Okay.\n(PERSON3) On totally different places different places on the Earth, but you know-\n<laugh/>\nBut that\u00b4s that\u00b4s okay.\nOkay.\n(PERSON8) Okay.\nSo you said [PERSON14], [PERSON10], [PERSON12] and?\n(PERSON3) Eh, maybe [PERSON15].\n(PERSON8) Okay, [PERSON15], [PERSON15].\n(PERSON3) Okay?\n(PERSON14) Okay.\n(PERSON8) Okay, thank you.\n(PERSON3) Thank you.\nSo then is the uh, the second next lost person?\n(PERSON4) Hello.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nYeah, okay, great.\nHi [PERSON4].\nSo to- to- to give everybody brief summary.\n[PERSON4] has worked on multi-target machine translation for his master thesis.\nWhich has been successfully defended in eh, in the starting the summer.\nAnd eh, now he eh, is also partly part-time employed on [PROJECT5] to develop multi source eh, models.\nTo to find up the the set up.\nAnd was there any other eh, type of model that we wanted you to train, or was it just this one?\u00a0\n(PERSON4) Currently we wanted to eh, abandon the multitarget set up and to eh, concentrate as as you assume multi source set up.\nAnd so far I only reselected some experiments on that suspect cluster and only have just just for the [ORGANIZATION3] cluster access.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON4) So n- not very much of progress so far.\nI have asked eh -\nMy task were so far to generate synthetic multi-source train set.\nAnd for this purpose, I asked [PERSON11] for model and he sent me the -\n(PERSON3) Great.\n(PERSON4) The place where it is.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON4) But when I will receive the cluster access I will check this out.\n(PERSON3) Yeh,so they should happen soon.\nI\u00b4m I\u00b4m sorry bu it\u00b4s a -\n(PERSON4) Yeah.\n(PERSON3) It\u00b4s just that still the paperwork is still in the process.\n<laugh/>\n(PERSON4) Ah, it\u00b4s still in the process.\nOkay, because I written there considering it is probably already okay to write them.\nSo -\n(PERSON3) Yeah, I\u00b4ll I\u00b4ll double check eh, today, if if if it\u00b4s already processed enough.\n(PERSON4) Yeah, but just in case that -\n(PERSON3) Somebody -\n(PERSON4) To have access to the system and cluster so I can do something what I can do there.\n(PERSON10) Okay.\nHow many GPUs can you run at one, at once?\n(PERSON3) It\u00b4s two GPUs per machine.\n(PERSON10) Okay.\nSo it\u00b4s not for 8 GPUs.\n(PERSON3) No.\n(PERSON4) Ah, well -\n<parallel_talk/>\n(PERSON3) But there some larger.\n(PERSON10) [PERSON3]?\nWhat is the -\nWhat is the memory of those GPUs?\n(PERSON11) Like this cluster is full.\nThis kind of -\nYou know.\n(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nIt is it is hard to receive more than one GPU there.\n(PERSON10) Okay, yes, so let\u00b4s wait for our cluster.\nI also started with multi-source synthetic corpus.\nAnd I and I think we need to to do it- itterative back translation on on Czech- German news to have some higher quality in German-Czech news corpus.\nAnd then we can combine it with with English- Czech, which is already high quality from [PROJECT1]\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON10) Then we can -\n(PERSON3) So so the models have to be of comparable quality, so that the uh, the multi-source has a chance to be useful, right?\nIs is that the idea?\n(PERSON10) Probably yes.\nAnd also we can take a look in the\u00a0 -\nAnd I can also send you eh how how they do this eh data collection in [ORGANIZATION6, if\u00a0 that would help.\nOr -\n(PERSON3) So maybe you can discuss like directly after the call.\nSo l- le- let let\u00b4s keep this call running for longer, but let\u00b4s finish the the common part.\nFor the common part I would just like to highlight the one more thing.\nAnd it\u00b4s [PERSON7]and [PERSON15].\nBoth of you should be working now on that multilingual [PROJECT4] systems, right?\nIs that kind of eh, of the current summary or are you more working on eh, s- whatever data augmentation for [PROJECT4] or -\nSo maybe [PERSON7]?\n(PERSON7) Um, well, I'm working on the chopped data set as already -\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\n(PERSON7) Already told you.\nYeah.\nSo it is kind of I don\u00b4t know whether it\u00b4s strictly -\n(PERSON3) The data augmentation.\n(PERSON7) But yeah, yeah.\nIt\u00b4s rather data data augmentation.\n(PERSON3) For better [PROJECT4].\nAnd your model is only for offline processing?\nEh, so eh, eh-\nHow far did you get with the onlinezation?\nBecause that is something which we would -\nIf your model eh, evaluates well, using [PROJECT2] on [PROJECT5] test set, we would like to have that integrated.\nBut I know that it\u00b4s eh, behaved differently.\nEh, it doesn\u00b4t emit word by word.\nSo eh, eh.\nIf we have anyone with the capacity and the best person will be probably [PERSON10].\nThen it would be great to eh, like ask someone to help you, for example [PERSON10], to to help you, with the onlinezation of your model.\nSo please keep that in mind eh, that we want to evaluate your model and if it looks good, then we want to have that integrated.\n(PERSON7) Yes, eh, the question is whether we would want to use just a [ORGANIZATION1]as a model.\nThe CTC eh end-to-end model or we want to use the extended one, the the cascaded model from my thesis.\nThe eh, the [ORGANIZATION1], translates\u00a0phonemes and then followed by transform.\n(PERSON3) Whichever whichever evaluates better in the offline run.\n(PERSON7) Yes, okay.\n(PERSON3) The the ev- the evaluation of the offline runs is, is the deciding thing.\nAnd I would like eh, to ask Umar to also work on the eh, on the same data and keep training.\nThe [ORGANIZATION13] set up, right?\n(PERSON15) Uhm.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, so people are disappearing.\nThank you for your participation.\nThat\u00b4s okay.\nThank you very much.\nAnd uh, just [PERSON15] just stay here with [PERSON7]Peter for second.\nEeh, yeah.\n(PERSON15) Yeah, sure.\n(PERSON3) So whenever [PERSON7], whenever you have the data ready, please get in touch with [PERSON15].\n[PERSON16] also please, train as a comparin- compa- comparison in using the exact same training data, exact of evaluation you two please be t- in touch together.\nSo that eh, ehm, s- we have this old style cascaded, the new style cascaded possibly eeh, and eh, the\u00a0the simple [ORGANIZATION1]only wou- on the same augmented data set evaluated ehagainst each other.\n(PERSON7) Okay.\n(PERSON3) Right?\nYeah, so I think -\nYeah?\n(PERSON10) I have one more idea for [PERSON4].\n(PERSON3) Mhm, okay.\n(PERSON10) You can try some transfer learning on on of double encoder model on small GPus.\nSo if if we have trained model for English-Czech and German-Czech, then then you can try to copy the parameters one encoder to to the double encoder model.\nFrom one model.\n(PERSON3) Mhm.\nAnd that\u00b4s continue training on on the multi-source data.\nSo that it\u00b4s pre-trained and it doesn\u00b4t eeeh like waste too much time in the in double encoder.\n(PERSON10) Yes then we can experiment with this on small models and small GPUs at first, and then -\n(PERSON3) Yes.\nSo that\u00b4s definitely -\nYes.\nThis this is a general recommendation that holds for everybody who is trying to uh, put together new things.\nAlways try it with small models and small data, and only once it works technically and does something very useful or on on this very small data set.\nThen use it eh, also a- applied on the large data.\nYeah, okay.\n(PERSON10) So so [PERSON4], if if you\u00b4re interested and I can write you some s- some points how to start.\nYou can contact me by e-mail.\n(PERSON11) Can you can you also maybe eh, if you are doing some communication.\nCan you maybe just g- send the copy to me so that I know what models you are working on since I'm working on similarly on some multi-targeted models.\n(PERSON4) Okay, yeah.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, oka.y\nSo I\u00b4ll have to leave myself at this moment as well.\nSo thank you very much for this call.\nI know it was very packed.\nAnd some of you ha- ha- have had only like few eh eh seconds of of like eh, strict things strictly relevant to you.\nBut it will get better eh, in the coming weeks as we like synchronize more.\nUh, so the the purpose of this meeting was eh, very greatly fulfilled.\nSo thank you again, and please, do the discussions, eh, pairwise or in in small teams as as we have discussed.\nI\u00b4ll now leave the call myself.\nAnd eh, so who was eh, supposed to keep talking.\nPlease keep talking on this call, feel free to do that.\nWhat\u00b4s what\u00b4s that.\n(PERSON14) So so I I also have to leave, my lecture is ongoing and I have eh, said my part and I know what I should do next.\nAnd whom I should get connected with so I I\u00b4ll do all of these things after after the lecture.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nOkay.\n(PERSON14) Sorry for -\n(PERSON3) Yeah, that\u00b4s that\u00b4s okay.\nThank you.\nBye [PERSON14].\n(PERSON14) Thank you and bye.\n(PERSON3) Yeah.\nSo bye everybody.\nYeah, thank you.\nBye bye.\n(PERSON15) [PERSON7] can you stay for a while.\n(PERSON3) So [PERSON7] is staying, right?\n[PERSON5] and [PERSON16], right?\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON3) So I'm making now [PERSON7]the host of this call.\nOkay?\n(PERSON7) Okay.\n(PERSON3) Yeah, thank you.\n(PERSON7) Ehm, [PERSON15] you wanted to ask something.\n(PERSON15) Yes.\nI have one or two - \nSo first of all I need <unintelligible/> on which you\u00b4re working <unintelligible/> can you share the path with me?\n(PERSON7) Um, yes sure, um.\nWhat I\u00b4m uh, really eh, working on is eh, like call it there chopped data set and with that I I I\u00b4m using regular eh, speech data set.\n[ORGANIZATION11]Common voice.\nAnd what I'm trying to do is to is to chop the utterences to words.\nSo I\u00b4m using first alignment and ehm, eeh, what I what I\u00b4m want to do is to to chop the the utterences and recreate new sentences using eh using using the words itself.\nSo it has eeh -\nFrom my point of view it has eeh, few few at- eh, few few eh <cough/>\nEeh, few things that can improve the eh, improve the the robustness of the [PROJECT4].\nAnd it is that eh, eh,\u00a0we can we can eh leverage more eh, non-native dat- non-native speakers, as we can reuse more frequently the words eh, spoken by non-natives.\nAnd also we can eh, create wholly new sentences, because ehm, when you\u00b4re training end to end [PROJECT4], which is my case.\nThe model is eeh, train not only the pronuncation model, but also also the language model.\nAnd this is especially hard, if we have only few data.\nAnd that\u00b4s actually the case of [ORGANIZATION11] Common voice.\n(PERSON15) Mhm.\n(PERSON7) Because eh, there are too many, you- sentence, ther- that\u00b4s eeh same or and they are just spoken by or read, because it it\u00b4s actually read data set.\nEeh, and these same sentences are eh, read by eh, several speakers.\nAnd that\u00b4s why the the models which are trained only on on common voice are quite bad.\nBecause the there are f- only few sentences and the language model is\u00a0 is quite bad then.\n(PERSON15) <unintelligible/> so it\u00b4s that non-native data set?\n(PERSON7) Uh, well, it\u00b4s partially non-native, partially native.\nEhm, I\u00b4m I don\u00b4t know the exact statistics.\nI can I can eh I can checkt it.\nEh -\n(PERSON15) Are you working on the same task which was due to the [ORGANIZATION14]challenge?\n(PERSON7) Sorry, once again, because I I didn\u00b4t understand.\n(PERSON15) I\u00b4m saying that are you working on the same, sorry.\nAre you working on the same thing that was due in [ORGANIZATION14] challenge or is it something else?\n(PERSON7) Uh, well, it\u00b4s not the Interspeech challenge, because it it was due twentieth of September.\nI guess.\nBut eh, it\u00b4s actually very similar.\nI I I got the data from the challenge.\nAnd I don\u00b4t know whether we can use these data.\n(PERSON15) Okay.\n<other_noise/>\n(PERSON7) I have to check I have to check\u00a0 whether we are allowed to use these data.\nBut eh, but for example, uh, there are in the in the [ORGANIZATION11] Common voice data set there are twenty three percent unit- United States English.\nThen there\u00b4s eight percent England English, five percent India and South Asia accent, four percent Australian English, three percent Canadian, two percent Scottish.\nOne percent Irish, one percent Southern African and one percent New Zealand English.\nOn the the data set also contains information about age and gender.\nNot all -\nNot all not all the data points have these eh, these attributes, but some of them do have.\nAnd eh, that\u00b4s why I'm using this data set.\nBut v- ve- very probably there\u00b4s even better data set that we can use for this.\n(PERSON15) Mhm.\nSo I I understand that but I couldn\u00b4t understand the main <unintelligible/> the main objective is it to train [PROJECT7] <unintelligible/> in English [PROJECT4]?\nIs it so?\n(PERSON7) Eeeeh, well, eh, the main objective is to train a robust [PROJECT4].\n(PERSON15) Robust English [PROJECT4].\nAnd what does the robust means?\nRobust to the more -\n(PERSON7) Ro-\nEm, robust towards accents and eh, mainly accents, but also generally robust by eh, creating eh, new sentences.\nOr new sentences or -\nUsing sentences that were not in the original data set.\nSo because eeh, there is a lots of textual written data sets.\n<other_noise/>\nOr we can we can use for example subtitles which is written spoken langu- written eh, written spoken language data set.\nAnd we can try to synthetize eh, using the existing words this new data sets.\nEven though we don\u00b4t have the original speech data.\n(PERSON15) It\u00b4s oh, so which which toolkit are you using?\n(PERSON7) Which to-?\n(PERSON15) Toolkit.\nWhich toolkit are you using?\n(PERSON7) Ehm, I am using the [ORGANIZATION4]toolkit.\n(PERSON15) Okay, fine.\nSo didn\u00b4t [PERSON3] mention something with multi-lingual [PROJECT4], or -\nI\u00b4m I got wrong.\n(PERSON7) Hm, well I should be I should start to work on multi-lingual [PROJECT4], but eeh, this this -\nBecause I I\u00b4m still at home and I eh, do not have much time to work.\nSo I\u00b4m this this eh, what I\u00b4m really doing now and eh, probably next week I\u00b4ll be in Prague\u00a0and I\u00b4ll start to work more more hard and maybe then I\u00b4ll I\u00b4ll be -\nI\u00b4ll start with the wil- with the multi-lingual [PROJECT4].\nAnd -\n(PERSON15) I would just confused that what he is actually waiting from -\nHe was something mentioning about the comparing the performance of your system with something <unintelligible/>\nSo was he talking about the this multi- accented [PROJECT4] or was he talking of multi-lingual [PROJECT4]?\n(PERSON7) Um, he was probably thinking the the [PROJECT4] I created or or ri- I\u00b4ll I\u00b4ve been using eh during my master the- thesis.\nAnd -\nThat was eh -\nWell, I was using eh, the original original eh, [PROJECT4] provided by [ORGANIZATION8].\nAnd I fine tuned it to -\nBecause it\u00b4s end-to-end model I fine- tuned it to recognize phonemes exe- eh, eh rather than graphemes.\nAnd I eh, trained my own transfomer model that would translate the phonemes into graphemes and add eh, pun- punctuation and eh, also to recover some errors.\nThat were in the transcripts.\nSo maybe he\u00b4s thinking about this.\n(PERSON15) So that that was an English [PROJECT4]?\n(PERSON7) Eh, English and Czech.\n(PERSON15)  Okay, okay.\nI I think I need need to work on whatever he was thinking about so I will just maybe first to <unintelligible/> the path of data from <unintelligible/>.\nAnd <unintelligible/> to evaluate the [PROJECT4].\nSo I need just eh, use the same data for [ORGANIZATION13] <unintelligible/> evaluations.\nDoes it make sense?\n(PERSON7) Yes, yes.\nSo eeh, what are the tasks we need to do -\nWell, ehm -\nThere\u00b4s these there are the data from the [ORGANIZATION14] challenge and we need to we need to check whether we can use these data.\n(PERSON15) Mhm.\n(PERSON7) But I'm afraid that these data are just eh, private and we cannot use them.\nEhm, but we need to check.\n(PERSON15) I I mean, if they there is something what he want So I can ask him once again.\n<unintelligible/>\nI know I\u00b4m bit confused.\n(PERSON7) And what next.\nMm, and of course, I\u00b4ll I\u00b4ll have to use the common voice and maybe I\u00b4ll check fo another\u00a0multilingual data set.\nBut uh, I guess the the [ORGANIZATION11]Common voice is the best option as-\nIf I recall correctly, the most papers that work with accented speech eh, were are working with the Common voice data set.\n(PERSON15) That\u00b4s bad.\nI think will multilingual <unintelligible/> through different things. Isn\u00b4t it so?\n(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMulti-lingual are different, and well, multi-accented are different.\nMaybe I have said wrong word.\nBut I I meant eh, multi-accented.\n(PERSON15) Okay, so so if that was that requirement, then please share the <unintelligible/> with me of the <unintelligible/> data set.\nWe train the set and we test it.\nAnd this <unintelligible/> will be [ORGANIZATION13] again or same model <unintelligible/>\nAnd then we - I think we can compare the <unintelligible/> of more systems.\n(PERSON7) Mhm mhm.\nYes.\n(PERSON15) So I'm leaving a message for you on <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) Well, if it\u00b4s okay for you I I\u00b4m not -\nI rather use mail.\nIf it\u00b4s okay for you.\n(PERSON15) Okay, that\u00b4s that\u00b4s <unintelligible/>\nI\u00b4ll then eh, leave the message for you on mail and whenever you have time <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) Okay, so I guess I think is evertyhing.\n(PERSON15) Is there anything?\n(PERSON7) I think it\u00b4s everything, yeah.\n(PERSON15) So okay, if we don\u00b4t have anything, thanks for your time.\n(PERSON7) Thank you very much too.\nBye.\n(PERSON15) Bye.\n", "utterances": [["20231027:094344", "user", " Tell me the exact list of participants to this meeting", 0], ["20231027:094347", "assistant", "The exact list of participants to this meeting includes:\n- PERSON2\n- PERSON7\n- PERSON3\n- PERSON11\n- PERSON14\n- PERSON15\n- PERSON10", -1], ["20231027:094955", "user", " Which event is going to be an important testbed for the project and the demo ?", 0], ["20231027:094959", "assistant", "The important testbed for the project and the demo event is the [ORGANIZATION7] conference, which is scheduled to take place in early December.
