This is achieved by conducting evaluation campaigns and benchmarking the systems against various metrics. The goal is to identify areas where the system's performance can be improved and make incremental adjustments or updates to achieve better accuracy, efficiency, or other desired qualities.\n\nThe ladder climbing process typically involves collecting data, performing evaluations, analyzing the results, and making necessary modifications to the STT models or their underlying components. It aims to gradually climb the metaphorical \"ladder\" of system performance, taking steps towards achieving higher accuracy and quality in speech recognition.\n\nIn the meeting, there was a mention of creating tables, using HTML or other formats, to present the results of the ladder climbing process for easier monitoring and comparison of system performance.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the concept of ladder climbing in the context of the meeting.
