room.\nAnd whose-\n(PERSON5) Oh, ok.\n(PERSON4) [PERSON2] is not coming?\n<censored/>\n(PERSON5) Oh, [PERSON2]\u00a0joined.\n(PERSON4) Yeah, [PERSON2]\u00a0joined.\u00a0\n[PERSON2] Hi, how are you?\u00a0\n(PERSON5) Hello, [PERSON2] can you hear us?\n(PERSON2) Hi, can you hear me?\n(PERSON4) Yes , how are you?\n(PERSON2) Oh, actually I 'm-\n(PERSON4) Oh, yey.\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> since-\n(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> list maybe\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Yeah, anyway was just lying down I can hear-\nI'm getting bored actually now.\nMy mom is not letting me do anything.\nSo.\n(PERSON4) Stay in the, stay in the bed and relax.\nIt's important.\nTo stay healthy.\n(PERSON5) Yes.\nTo, [PERSON4] do you have anything specific to discuss today?\n(PERSON4) Not very specific I wanted to thank you for preparing this [ORGANIZATION2] forms for alignment annotations.\nIt's very useful and pleasant to use actually.\nTo have all this spreadsheet with all the annotators that download their data there, it's very nice.\u00a0\nReally having overview for what was done.\nAnd I can answer them, it's really nice.\n(PERSON5) Ok, so [PERSON4] I was like looking through the task that we need to do.\nAs specifically I need to do very quickly for the like for the workshop proposal.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) And here it seems to be mimi.\nSo, so let me just quickly give you an overview.\nThat what, what we have to do very quickly is we have to uh set up the website now.\nSo, Ah I have connected to the person whom [PERSON6] reffered.\nAnd he reverted to me back with a link and say that you can do it there.\nSo I'm get to see that how it looks like to do with the [ORGANIZATION1], ah, website.\nWhat I was wondering like if we can quickly do it on a Github or something.\nI do not know, like how much it time will take to do with the [ORGANIZATION1] website?\n(PERSON4) It may be similar.\nI do not know either.\nShould I ask [PERSON6]?\nI have no experience with that.\n(PERSON5) Okay, okay.\nSo, let me first look into that um, like, how does it works, uh, to do with\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0and something.\nBecause I'm not very experienced with those technologies.\nSo I have to see, but if it is, if it is tough, I would not do.\n<unintelligible/> do it in Github and do it very quickly.\n(PERSON4) Yeah.\n(PERSON5) <unintelligible/> like do much more timing to, into these things.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) So, yeah.\nSo one thing is setting up the website,\u00a0but the website should have, uh, the content like, ah, the call for participations.\n(PERSON4) So the website of Ah, the\u00a0<unintelligible/>, of the, of the special event.\n(PERSON5) Yes, yes, yes.\n(PERSON4) Mmm.\n(PERSON5) So it will contain the call for participation.\nUh the program committee.\nUh the dates and the submission information type\u00a0in the review process, location and stuff.\nSo these are easy to do.\nLike but we have to write about the call for participation.\nSo I will like uh start writing them here today.\nMmm, but I was requiring your input.\nLike, let me write it first version, and then, um, like maybe you, [PERSON2] and [PERSON6] should comment on that.\u00a0\n(PERSON4) They comment to that, of course.\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\n(PERSON4) Of course we will comment on that, yes.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, sure.\nOk.\nSo after this is done then at the same time [PERSON4] I will also ask you [PERSON4] and [PERSON2].\nPlease try to invite people for like reviewers for the share task\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\nSo.\nYeah, so I will share with both of you a\u00a0<unintelligible/> e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to-\n(PERSON4) I don't know-\nI don't have any, I don't have any connections in this summarization field.\nI'm\u00a0<unintelligible/> new there.\n(PERSON5) No, no, not require, not require [PERSON4], not require to like only for summarization, ok?\n(PERSON4) But how-\n(PERSON5) We have to show we have a good program committee.\nSo I think you already-\nYou already brought the-\n(PERSON4) Not summarization people.\n(PERSON5) Like no one is going to check, you know.\nSo that's it.\n<laugh/>\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\n(PERSON4) They will know that they are good, but at the same time they will not know that they are summarization people.\nI don't know.\u00a0\n(PERSON5) So you have already\u00a0brought three people, right?\nAs participants.\nSo even big and like agree to do uh review at least one or two papers.\n(PERSON4) Well, they are okay, maybe.\nOkay.\n(PERSON5) You can just ask them, because eventually, like finally, it depends on how many papers we are getting.\nAnd ah, like um.\nAnd then we can invite more people based on how many papers we are getting, okay?\nSo that is\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0 requirement, but for in the website we have to show at least, I will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee.\n(PERSON4) More than 20 people in the program committee.\n(PERSON5) Yes, yes, yes, yes.\nSo like we have many good uh contexts, like, for example, from [ORGANIZATION1] only we can have two or more than three or four people.\nExcluding as the organizers.\nSo one could be\u00a0<unintelligible/>,\u00a0uh, you might know someone.\nSo yeah.\n(PERSON4) Hm-hm.\n(PERSON5) And so let us let me write the draft e-mail and share it with you.\nSo I think this this can be done easily uh.\nAnd yeah.\nSo uh can you open that particular doc that I shared uh\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0about inter-\n(PERSON4) This overview?\nOverleaf.\n(PERSON5) Not overleaf.\n[ORGANIZATION2] doc.\nOk, let me share it with you again.\n(PERSON4) Yes, thank you.\n(PERSON5) Hold on.\nOkay, so this is no correct thing.\nSo I, I just shared at the Zoom chat.\n(PERSON4) Oh, does not work\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON5) Which one?\n(PERSON4) No one.\nJust [ORGANIZATION2] Docs is kind of uh it does not work today.\n(PERSON5) Oh, why is it?\n(PERSON4) Just [ORGANIZATION2] today is busy.\nIt happened to us already, once with [PERSON6] now.\nJust it does not work.\nI do not know.\nI can 't open it.\n(PERSON2) How can I help you?\n(PERSON4) I don't know, but [PERSON6] told that today [ORGANIZATION2] doesn't work.\n<laugh/>\n(PERSON5) Yes, I can also see that.\nIt's not working.\n(PERSON4) Yeah.\nSomehow.\nSo what I already opened, it it works.\nBut the new [ORGANIZATION2] documents are, so don't work.\nSo I should download it, it doesn't work.\n(PERSON5) Okay, anyway.\nSo uh let me tell you uh briefly.\nUh so the thing is like a for the website we need this thing uh to be ready.\nAnd uh like uh we have to have the membership\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\nFor that I have mail to professor [PERSON1], I guess.\nSo, he is yet to respond back that we should do the individual membership, or we should do institutional membership so that we have to know what to do.\nAnd yes.\nSo these are the, like, immediate pending task for preparing the proposals.\n(PERSON4) I think I 'm a little bit lost and\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\nWhat was the last information I.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, so we have to also like get the\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0membership right.\nSo uh for that, I have mail to that-\n(PERSON4) Aha, okay, I see on my\u00a0<unintelligible/>, ok.\n(PERSON5) And I was looking at the, into some challenges of for the last year and their websites.\nSo we are going to like make that uh similar to them.\nLike the content.\n(PERSON4) Hm.\n(PERSON5) Yes and.\nYeah, I think that is it.\n(PERSON4) Oh, okay.\nSo what does it mean for us?\n<unintelligible/>\u00a0read your document and then we will see.\nYes?\nWait for trust.\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\n(PERSON4) Ok.\n(PERSON5) Wait for the draft and, yeah.\nSo I will send you the email draft to themselves.\nAnd uh maybe like uh, I will also copy on to it so that he can also invite some more people into the program committee.\n(PERSON4) Definitely, definitely um copy to [PERSON6].\nBecause, yes he is the person who could have know about somebody.\n(PERSON5) Mhm, right.\nOkay, so this is it.\nUh it seems a lot of work to do.\nFor this.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) For this workshop thing.\nBecause, you know, like um, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\nSo and I think none of us are from someization background.\nSo-\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) We have to work extra hard.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\u00a0\nNone of us from-\nYou're also, you're also not from the summarization background?\n(PERSON5) No.\n(PERSON4) Aha.\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\nSo that is, anyway, I did not thought like, um, like making a share task would be that much challenging.\n(PERSON4) Mhm.\nWell, I\u00a0<unintelligible/> that it is\u00a0challenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that.\nI think you manage it.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing uh some workshops with\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\nBut thing is that there are like, like, the organizing committee is very big.\nAnd so all of us are doing some, some, some portion, ok?\nBut I, like I am mostly looking into the like publicity and the website.\nUh for that.\nAnd also a bit on writing the paper uh for that uh, but I did not like, um,\u00a0<unintelligible/> share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) And the thing is like for us full legit workshop we don't have content.\nYou know.\nSo that is why we have to focus on-\n(PERSON4) Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input.\nWe have just the results of the experiment.\n(PERSON5) Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization.\nSo that they could can think of many content.\nWe are just focusing on only one data, right.\nLike only one aspect of summarization.\n(PERSON4) Yes, well, actually this discussion makes me totally frustrated.\nBecause originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task.\nIt means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results.\nNow we make a scientific workshop.\nWe need invited speakers on the topic and articles on the topic.\nI really, I can 't help beat frustrated how it is it is possible to do.\nBut you are and [PERSON6] are optimistic.\nSo, why not.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, I think uh like uh, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific.\nBecause we do not really have content for the workshop.\n(PERSON4) Yes, yes.\nBut it is also actually not a workshop it's a satellite event.\nAt the satellite event maybe\u00a0<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON5) Right, right, that's the exact word.\n<unintelligible/> not call it a workshop.\n(PERSON4) Yes, let's not call it a workshop.\nYes, let's call it an event.\n(PERSON5) And for the like\u00a0<unintelligible/> speakers also like we have to invite some\u00a0<unintelligible/> for the input.\nBecause uh we have\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0to some like prominent people in summarization.\nUh for uh like uh for some other topic.\nUh so, but uh like they did not like, they didn't like responded affordably so they were actually not available.\n(PERSON4) So you address somebody?\n(PERSON5) Yes, yes, many, me and [PERSON6] we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.\n(PERSON4) Aha.\n(PERSON5) But they are very, like they are very famous professors, including [PERSON3],\u00a0<unintelligible/> and-\n(PERSON4) And they did not answer?\n(PERSON5) No, they did answer, but they said, they were very busy.\n(PERSON4) But what?\n(PERSON5) They said they were very busy.\n(PERSON4) All of them answer that they-\nSo everybody declined.\n(PERSON5) Yes, yes.\n(PERSON4) Aha, ok.\n(PERSON5) But the thing is that we\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0to like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know.\nIf we could have reached out to some early career people that would have been great from summarization.\nBut anyway, we have to think of\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0who has already worked on summarization.\nSo for that, I will talk to [PERSON6].\n(PERSON4) Mhm.\nI do not know anybody.\nI really do not know at all this earlier at all.\nMaybe\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0could know somebody.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, maybe.\n(PERSON4) You didn't ask him.\n(PERSON5) No, I 'm going to ask him to be a part of the program committee because he declined to be a part of the organizing committee.\n(PERSON4) Mhm.\n(PERSON5) I'm going to ask him to be part of the program committee.\n(PERSON4) Yeah,\u00a0<unintelligible/> is definitely a good idea.\nHe should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee.\nProbably he could know somebody for keynote.\nSo from this\u00a0<unintelligible/>\u00a0media generations so, little bit younger, say.\n(PERSON5) Mhm.\nSo uh in this regard.\nBut feel uh [ORGANIZATION3] is is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from [ORGANIZATION1], right?\n(PERSON4) As a, as a what?\nWhat?\n(PERSON5) As a\u00a0<unintelligible/> does it make sense like someone from [ORGANIZATION1] to deliver the keynote?\nI do not think so.\nBecause we are part of the organizing committee right?\n(PERSON4) Hm, I do not know.\nSo if it is somebody, why not if it could be, if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic, but I do not know the person.\nI do not know who could have this talk.\n(PERSON5) Mhm.\nUm-hum.\nYeah, right.\n(PERSON4) As as I think about summarization, I knew just a couple of very young students who began to do the year.\nMy gisters work on Phd.\nActually I do not know about senior people for just summarization.\n(PERSON5) Yes.\nAnd that too in terms of speech, not really text.\nMm, so let me ask, let me ask [PERSON6]\u00a0<unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON4) Should I, should you, do you want to ask him now?\n(PERSON5) Ehm, I can e-mail him or how do you propose to ask him?\n(PERSON4) Yes, yes, yes.\n(PERSON5) Ok.\n(PERSON4) No, he's in the next room.\n(PERSON5) Oh, ok.\n(PERSON4) In the office.\n(PERSON5) So if he is available maybe he can, would he be able to join?\nOr maybe-\n(PERSON4) I will ask him.\nI will ask him.\nAs you say, as you-\nAs you tell.\n(PERSON5) I think just let me-\n(PERSON4) Ok, let\u00a0<unintelligible/>, write him an e-mail, yes.\n(PERSON5) Ok, so I will do that.\nAnything else [PERSON4]?\nWe are going to discuss?\n(PERSON4) No, I think no.\nThis proposal isn't important.\nIt doesn't have sense to thing about to to discuss summarization.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.\n(PERSON4) I think you're totally busy with this topic now.\n(PERSON5) Yes, I try to figure out what are the other things that we need to take care of.\n(PERSON4) Yes.\n(PERSON5) Ok, anything else?\n[PERSON2] do you want to like share or we can drop for today.\n(PERSON4) I think we can drop.\n[PERSON2] should stay in bed.\n(PERSON5) Yes, take rest.\n(PERSON4) Yeah, take rest.\n(PERSON5) Exactly.\n(PERSON4) And be healthy as soon as possible.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah, just take rest, yeah.\nOk then.\n(PERSON4) Bye then.\n(PERSON5) Yeah,\u00a0<unintelligible/>, ok, bye.\n(PERSON4) Bye.\n", "utterances": [["20231010:171618", "user", " What was the purpose of the meeting ?
