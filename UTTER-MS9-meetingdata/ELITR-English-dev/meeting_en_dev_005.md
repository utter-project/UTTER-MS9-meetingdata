REMARKS

Many times, the model is answering (correctly) like this

*“The number of participants expected at the Students Firm Fair was not mentioned in the meeting transcript. However, it was mentioned that there were around 400 high school students who would be presenting their companies at the fair.”*


There might be some issues with the transcripts and there are more errors at the end !
maybe the annotators confused (PERSON11) and (PERSON16)
