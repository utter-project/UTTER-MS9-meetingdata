[PROJECT2] Surge 2020 Organization

Thu Jan 30, 13.00, in front of 423
- [PERSON14]:
-- upcoming sessions where domain adaptation would be good:
- [PERSON14], [PERSON15], â€¦ doing a dry-run workshop on Feb 12 at [ORGANIZATION1]
- [PERSON14] (or possibly someone else?) giving Monday seminar on [PROJECT2] on Feb 17; domain-adapted subtitling expected, who can help with domain adaptation?
- Student Firms Fair: March 18-20
- this will need serious preparations, all non-native high-school students
- PROFANITY FILTERING is severely WANTED for this
-- both pre-listed bad words
-- as well as *live* adding of other bad words
-- in source, or MT outputs
- Another option
 
-- Search for future topics/tasks in [PROJECT2] Monday Tests, not all are marked by WANTED; see esp. the last two sessions.
- [PERSON16]:
-- 1970-1980 PDF files from the [OTHER3] court of auditors (bundesrechnungshof)
-- 15k sentences is now the corpus in English and [OTHER3]; cleaning is now needed
- [PERSON3]
-- adding the command to decompress audio
-- working on multi-source config of [PROJECT1]
- [PERSON17]
-- evaluation tool is finished, now writing up the paper draft
-- recommends to organize them in a google drive folder
- [PERSON7]
-- worked on [LOCATION1] ASR adaptation for [PERSON4]'s talks
-- big improvements achieved, many domain specific words were recognized
- [PERSON2]
-- Asking about compression; the Librispeech was converted to mp3, then flac, then to wav; so [PERSON2]'s 
-- Sound segmentation: some words get cut at window boundaries
- The current improved implementation works for windows of 4 to 8 seconds, first finding word boundaries, then respecting them
-- Waiting for [PERSON13] to test this new segmenter.
-- Segmentation has to respect speaker boundaries (but that is generally not an issue in our setups).
- [PERSON8]
-- ([PERSON14] quickly introduced [PERSON8])
-- Waiting for virtual machine for the paraphrasing server
-- Will start visualization of sound input, all channels; as if audacity was recording but without recording.
-- Paper FastSpeech, Dec 2019, [ORGANIZATION3] 300x faster, so could run locally.
- WANTED check if 4there is code for that and integrate it
- [PERSON11]
-- Getting scripts ready for [PERSON4]'s talk.
-- Not much work done this week,next -To-do's
- Prime focus (segmenter)- full stop and its recall
- Implement truecasing,  capitalization of Proper Nouns.
