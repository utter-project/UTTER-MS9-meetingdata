find in the \u2013\nif you have accepted ehm that ehm meeting invite, it is the same link.\n(PERSON7) mmhm, so that's \u2013\n(PERSON6) Meetings only.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\nSo this [ORGANIZATION2] link will also \u2013 ehm will also function the next time we ehm have the coffee meeting.\n(PERSON6) Yea, yea, yea.\nIt is the \u2013 it is the rolling [ORGANIZATION2] link,\nwe can use it ehm like for \u2013 for all of our meetings, so \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, okay, nice.\n(PERSON6) For all our coffee meetings.\n(PERSON7) Perfect, I just \u2013\n(PERSON6) So I'll also put \u2013 I'll also put the [ORGANIZATION2] link as well as the [ORGANIZATION2] link, so <unintelligible/> is suitable for us.\nWe can <unintelligible/>\nSo in the same \u2013 same meeting invite you can find <unintelligible/> links.\n(PERSON7) Okay, mmhm.\nThank you, thank you.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) And now let's wait before [PERSON4] or \u2013 a- and [PERSON2] are connecting.\n(PERSON6) mmhm\n<unintelligible/> said that he had another meeting ehm before ehm a- \nso from Doodle so \u2013 so \u2013 th- th- an hour before \u2013 before that.\nMaybe he didn't finish yet, I'm not sure. \n(PERSON6) Okay.\nSo, [PERSON7], so <unintelligible/> let discuss some things, okay?\n(PERSON7) mmhm mmhm\n(PERSON6) So, I \u2013 I wanted to note that \u2013\nehm so, I didn't know <unintelligible/> \u2013\nit was like \u2013\nI don't think there is <unintelligible/> there is the \u2013 ehm everything I <unintelligible/> clean manually corrected transcript as well as <unintelligible/>.\nIs that correct?\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) So our output is ma- manually corrected minutes and manually corrected transcript.\nIs that what you asked?\n(PERSON6) I \u2013 I \u2013 I want to know that how do you have <unintelligible/>?\nLike, how do the <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) ehm Okay.\nehm Did you see the document Minuting annotation guidelines?\nProbably \u2013\n(PERSON6) Yes.\n(PERSON7) If I ehm \u2013\nif we look at it together and I will just ehm detailise some things that you want to know ehm \u2013\nso ehm, ehm I will send you a link to minutes annotation, so that you can open it now.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) ehm Do we have some chat here?\nYes.\n(PERSON6) ehm Maybe you can send it to the hangnote.\n(PERSON7) ehm I have already sent it by chat, but I also can sent it by hangnotes.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) ehm <unintelligible/> is right that [ORGANIZATION2] is not working for <unintelligible/>.\nHow is it possible?\n(PERSON6) Oh, yeah, how is it possible?\n(PERSON7) So how is it possible that some link is working and another doesn't?\n(PERSON6) I don't know.\nBut [ORGANIZATION2] is like, you know, much bigger than [ORGANIZATION2] meet.\n(PERSON7) I also think \u2013\n(PERSON6) And we have problems.\n(PERSON7) And especially I can hear much better with [ORGANIZATION2] than with [ORGANIZATION2] meet.\n(PERSON6) Right, right, exactly.\n(PERSON7) One more thing is \u2013 is that they want to make it ehm \u2013\nso that \u2013 so we sh- we have to pay for it beginning till next month or so.\n(PERSON6) Oh, <unintelligible/>?\n(PERSON7) [ORGANIZATION2] meet.\nIt's not going to be free any more.\n(PERSON6) Oh, it is already free for one hour.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON6) But more then one hour you have to pay.\n(PERSON7) Oh, one hour, okay.\nIt's not <unintelligible/> actually, okay.\nehm So \u2013\n(PERSON6) But [ORGANIZATION2] meet is also free for fourty minutes, but I want to <unintelligible/> [PERSON7], how like ehm [PERSON6] ehm like be have got like the paid for <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION2].\nBecause <unintelligible/> [PERSON6] seems that [ORGANIZATION2] meeting link, it is obvious the \u2013 like <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) ehm We have the paid version of [ORGANIZATION2] for our faculty.\nehm But \u2013\n(PERSON6) Oh \u2013\n(PERSON7) There are some [ORGANIZATION2]s that we prepaid, but ehm I'm not sure if it's a good option for lo- for our coffee m- coffee meetings.\nBecause ehm that's kind of for everybody and ehm if we have not cross with other ehm \u2013 with other courses that are going on on ehm \u2013 at our faculty.\n(PERSON6) Okay, okay.\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) You really have to follow if nobody else is \u2013 s- needs this hour for their teaching,\nso it's better to have something outside.\n(PERSON6) So [PERSON7], could you \u2013 could you respond to <unintelligible/>, like if he can reensolve [ORGANIZATION2] and then join, because in [ORGANIZATION2] meet it is really difficult to hear.\n<typing/>\n(PERSON7) mmhm\n(PERSON6) Okay.\nehm Well, ehm so, what we \u2013 ehm we begin this ehm data collection.\nehm I will try ehm to make a very ehm short presentation how I do that.\nehm So, we have automatic speech reconstruction transcripts.\nSo we have transcripts with really bad automatic quality, which I send to the annotator and ask him to correct the data.\nAnd I also send him ehm the audio file or video file ehm via FileSender.\nehm This is some service of our university that I can send ehm big ehm attachements.\nI send a big attachement via some server and link to it,\nand in the attachement of the e-mail i send him the pre-processed automatic speech reconstructed \u2013 speech reconstruction transcript.\nehm So this is the stage one, transcript annotation, and he listens to the audio and corrects the transcript.\nAfter that ehm he ehm writes ehm from stretch the minutes and send them to me.\nThis is \u2013\n(PERSON6) <unintelligible/> Hold on.\nSo when you send that \u2013\nso <unintelligible/> so what the annotator does is that he or she listens to the audio, and also goes to the automatic speech \u2013 ehm speech transcript.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON6) ehm And then?\nHe or she corrects that?\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON6) Also based on how they understand it?\n<unintelligible/>, am I right?\n(PERSON7) He creates the minutes, yes.\nehm Mostly I \u2013\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) <unintelligible/> not to give them the original minutes.\nSo if they really ask for that, I can \u2013 I sometimes send them ehm just for \u2013\nonce <unintelligible/> they look like, but mostly \u2013\n(PERSON6) But <unintelligible/>\nWhat is the original minutes?\n(PERSON7) This is ehm just what [PERSON6] created duri-\nthe agenda for the minutes.\n(PERSON6) So this is the \u2013 like \u2013 <unintelligible/> by the participant, great.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\nThis is mostly \u2013 it \u2013 this is what was created by [PERSON6] ehm within our [PROJECT1] minutes \u2013 [PROJECT1] meetings.\n(PERSON7) So there are ehm \u2013\nif you look at the data, there are a lot of ehm docs there and data copy pasted from ehm [ORGANIZATION2] documents.\nehm And the documents ehm contain original agenda of the meeting, which was created by [PERSON6] or [PERSON3] before the meeting and partially ehm s- <unintelligible/> extended during the meetings, or sometimes after the meeting.\nBut this is kind of work version of what really was.\n(PERSON6) Okay, so I would like to ask you now \u2013\nSo, by this original meetings, what <unintelligible/> [PERSON6] and [PERSON3] has created, so it is just for reference of the annotators.\nSo <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON7) This is just for what?\nSorry, once more please.\n(PERSON6) This is just for the reference of the annotators.\nehm Do you think it has any practical significance to our \u2013 ehm our <unintelligible/> or media task?\n(PERSON7) I think it has, it may have.\nIt's not \u2013\nso this is also the output.\n<unintelligible/> doesn't have the full representation as needed yet, but it can be changed to this presentation and it also reflects the essence of the meeting.\nso I cannot actually say that they are worse that the min- minutes created by annotators.\nIt is actually a questions, because there are some drawbacks of those originnal minutes, because ehm they do not contain some information or they may contain something that was not discussed during the meeting.\nBut on the other hand they are rea ehm, so they contain real names ehm and they don't have errors in \u2013 ehm in the content.\nSo actually they're not worse.\nWe can put them together with other ehm \u2013 with transcripts and get more, just get more \u2013\n(PERSON6) So, not all the meetings has the original minutes, right?\n(PERSON7) ehm Yes, ehm we try to get original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes ehm it may be very short for example, for \u2013\nSome group of meetings, for example for [PROJECT2], ehm the minutes are very very short and they contain just one line [PROJECT2] book.\nAnd they discuss the book, not detailise it anymore.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\nOkay, so, so ask <unintelligible/> line is good.\nSo, you send this via file sender, and they <unintelligible/> you back the manually corrected ASR?\nAnd the minute for <unintelligible/>, right?\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON6) Okay. \n(PERSON7) And I put in \u2013\nI put it to the server.\n(PERSON6) You put it <unintelligible/>.\nSo now, how did it work?\nSo did the teams <unintelligible/> directions?\nNow how did it work.\n(PERSON7) ehm Now it works the same, we din't \u2013 we didn't change it yet.\nBut after we change it \u2013\nSo we didn't change anything yet, so actually ehm, probably you have to change it.\n(PERSON6) ehm No.\nI want to say that support after the team watch them, where from today look the <unintelligible/>.\nToday we look into the server, or should I have to be in touch with the annotator?\n(PERSON7) This is the question we discussed today in the morning.\nehm So [PERSON6] proposes that annotators do that themselves.\nWe proposed that they will send the data to us.\nehm So I still kind of \u2013\nso at the moment I do not have any idea hw to technically work with the variant that annotators send the data via GateHub.\n[PERSON6] \u2013 [PERSON6] is very much for that so that we really do that GateHub team and they can push and pull the data to the GateHub.\nehm But at the moment I'm not ready to say how it should be organised, because I have to give them ehm tasks ehm s-\nI have to say them'Now you ehm write this and that \u2013 this meeting' ehm, I have to correct it, so I have to look if their transcript and the minutes are ehm okay.\nI have to provide \u2013 provide them with the audio and video file,\nand this is an extra action that should be done apart from GateHub, because it is a hard file.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON2) ehm Sorry to interupt you [PERSON7], I think that [PERSON6] already decided not to include \u2013 not to ehm let them <parallel_talk/> Yes. <parallel_talk/> work with GeteHub, because it deleted the \u2013 the team.\nIt deleted the team <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON7) Yes, but after <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON2) But I think we \u2013 I think we agreed that they will keep communicating with you in the same way and that <unintelligible/> will manage log it up \u2013\n(PERSON7) Well, well \u2013\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> what you will \u2013\n(PERSON7) [PERSON2], not really, because afterwards, after that meeting, he said me many times h- that he still s- sees that it should be maybe changed.\nSo maybe not today but he still sees the option ehm better that this teams would be created again, <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Okay, <laugh/> so then we need another meeting I guess.\nthen we need another meeting with [PERSON6].\n(PERSON7) Not too long, but he- s kind of ehm \u2013\nwe ehm spoke about that GateHub for a while ehm after tha- afterwards.\n(PERSON2) Okay.\n(PERSON7) He \u2013 wha- he didn't try to persuade me to made these teams, but in his vision this teams still figurated somehow.\n(PERSON2) Okay, okay.\n(PERSON7) Probably we should \u2013\n(PERSON2) So, [PERSON7] \u2013\n(PERSON7) Not exclude this option for the moment, ehm but \u2013\n(PERSON2) Okay, so, [PERSON7], I \u2013 yeah I \u2013 so \u2013 so this is like you <unintelligible/> to upload the minute <unintelligible/> correct, so this is actually a list work for us.\nSo we sould be absolutely happy with that.\nBut the thing is, or the only thing we worry is, because since you said <unintelligible/> technical people, so if something goes wrong <unintelligible/>, otherwise we're absolutely fine with that.\n(PERSON7) What is absolutely fine?\n(PERSON2) Like if the annotators up- upload the minute themselves, so \u2013\n(PERSON7) Actually I'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me \u2013 ehm I should think it over and I didn't do it yet.\nSo I don't know how would I have the control o- over annotators.\nThe communication.\nBecause I have to send them what all the files manually, otherwise \u2013\nso I don't know how to do that.\nI really have to upload the data and it takes time.\n(PERSON2) I \u2013 I think the same [PERSON7], I absolutely agree with you.\nI would not ask this persons to push in GateHub <parallel_talk/> Yes. <parallel_talk/> in the final repository ehm to push there anything.\nSo I would also gain ehm \u2013 say that ehm I prefer this \u2013 the same strategy that you're using, <unintelligible/> sending the data \u2013\n(PERSON7) So probably let's \u2013 yes.\nLet's not do this team for the moment.\nIt could be changed, I think it could \u2013\nso, wh- I and [PERSON6] still thought about this option is not \u2013 not because of the present situation.\nNow it's absolutely okay, that we just send them the data.\nBut he thought, overal the situation where they make alignments and it takes more time and ehm somehow it can \u2013 it \u2013 it can \u2013\nit is connected with alignments.\nehm\n(PERSON2) Okay, okay.\n(PERSON7) So let's not think about it at the moment if possible.\nAnd if needed we would ehm kind of build it on the- ehm \u2013 on the existing system.\nSo at the moment I would prefer to have the contact with annotators, but ehm actually I'm really <parallel_talk/> Wonderful. <parallel_talk/> good in that, so rather use <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Okay. \n(PERSON6) So, <unintelligible/> [PERSON7], so ehm \u2013 so ehm \u2013 let \u2013 [PERSON2] said in the morning \u2013\nI also like \u2013\nto some extent I thought and I \u2013 I think I also believe to some extent \u2013\nso \u2013 ehm <unintelligible/> we have an actually manual evaluation <unintelligible/>.\nWhat is the \u2013 like, what is the vision <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON7) Aou want me to repeat why you need the alignment?\nWhy we need the al-\n(PERSON6) No, no.\nI \u2013 I need the al-\nI \u2013 understood we need the alignment, but ehm I was talk <unintelligible/>, so we must have a measure or a <unintelligible/> by which we can use the alignment to produce something.\n(PERSON7) mmhm\n(PERSON6) Great, so, we do alignment, <unintelligible/> fine, the manual <unintelligible/> are done, but what is the final output?\nIt should be some <unintelligible/> files and some nubers.\n(PERSON7) Final oi- output of what.\n(PERSON6) Final output of the alignment.\n(PERSON7) ehm <unintelligible/>, could I ask you, please, now, if you could write this very question very explicitly somewhere into \u2013 into the agenda.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) Because I think ehm there should be a total understand\u2013 understanding between us what do you mean.\nI'm not sure ehm \u2013\nfirst I'm not sure that I understand what you ask and second I'm not sure  \u2013 I'm not sure I can answer.\nI'd rather think that answer should go from other source.\n(PERSON6) Okay.\nOkay, so I'm <unintelligible/> typing in that \u2013 ehm in that \u2013\n(PERSON7) Just form the question.\n(PERSON6) \u2013 [ORGANIZATION2] doc.\n(PERSON7) mmhm\n(PERSON6) So how are we going to use the alignment in evaluation?\n<typing/>\nWhat is the measure or mid-check of this activity?\n(PERSON7) mmhm Well, I \u2013 ehm now I understand it.\nI think it's a very good question and ehm I don't think that we have answered it yet.\nSo we as-\n[PERSON6] has kind of vague idea that it helps and so have I.\nehm So this w- ehm\nso we have some ehm experimen- experience with other tasks where such alignment helped somehow.\nAnd we have the intuition ehm based on some experiment- experiments with other data, that it would help.\nProbably I'm a little bit sceptic now, but ehm I \u2013 I really think that at the moment it is not solved.\nSo this is what \u2013 ehm\nif you would ask [PERSON6] this question he would probably say that ehm <unintelligible/> think about it and ehm make o ehm or invent the measure or metric for \u2013 for that.\nSo I've like \u2013 I \u2013 I would pick up from this here, so the thing is that ehm meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy.\nLike I'm just talking form <unintelligible/> point of view.\nSo, probably we have to submit the proposal ehm within the first week of November.\nOkay, so, it \u2013\nI do see th- this coming within October, that I'll be <unintelligible/> measure and that is accepted that, okay?\nThis is a manual measure for ehm automatic minority.\nSo the thing is that this is <unintelligible/>, right?\nSo, do you think that it could be <unintelligible/> thing?\nBecause ehm if we ehm like \u2013\nI don't want a <unintelligible/> that \u2013\nsuppose we say about \u2013\n(PERSON7) Sorry, sorry, I lost the u- lost the idea.\nehm Do you think that we should include what, evaluation measure?\n(PERSON6) Do you think this alignment \u2013\n(PERSON7) Or alignment?\n(PERSON6) First, alignment first, manual evaluation measure \u2013\n(PERSON7) Okay \u2013\n(PERSON6) Should be a part of the shared task?\n(PERSON7) ehm <unintelligible/> I don't think about it.\nI don't know, I have no idea.\nSo I really don't know.\nI think this is the <unintelligible/> you should discuss in more detail with [PERSON6].\n(PERSON6) mmhm\n(PERSON7) Because \u2013\n(PERSON6) So I <unintelligible/> this points.\n(PERSON7) mmhm \n(PERSON6) So this \u2013\nI would say \u2013\n(PERSON7) I have never had any experiments with shared task and measures and so on.\nSo I \u2013 what I am saying is kind of my intuition.\nehm I <parallel_talk/> Okay. <parallel_talk/> cannot answer.\n(PERSON6) mmhm Okay.\n(PERSON7) Rather ehm \u2013\ngo-\neither think with [PERSON4] about ehm \u2013 about that or ehm think ehm with [PERSON4], [PERSON2] and [PERSON6], not me, I don't know.\n(PERSON6) mmhm Yeah, okay, okay.\nOkay, thank you.\nehm Okay, so- suppose they does speak a scenario that we don't come up with a manual evaluation measure, before the shared task, so, what options we have.\nSo the options that we have is \u2013 we have the transcript, which is manually corrected, we have the minute, which is the <unintelligible/>,  contains the <unintelligible/> summary.\nAnd then ehm we reuse the data and we evaluate the submissions based on automatic measure.\n(PERSON7) ehm Do we \u2013\nwhere do we get the automatic measure?\n(PERSON6) There are many automatic measures for summarisation.\n(PERSON7) mmhm But <unintelligible/> none of them works as [PERSON4] realised.\n(PERSON6) ehm How many ehm do you have tried?\n(PERSON7) How many what?\n(PERSON6) How many \u2013 how many automatic measures have you ehm tried?\n(PERSON7) ehm Ask [PERSON4].\n(PERSON6) Okay.\n(PERSON7) Let \u2013\nehm so in summarising paper on that <unintelligible/> maybe [PERSON2] also knows, none of them really works well.\n(PERSON2) Well I wouldn't say none of them really works well, I would say that they are kind of deceptive in some cases like they tch- they are very high \u2013 very high <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes mmhm.\n(PERSON2) And then somebody <unintelligible/> just <unintelligible/> repeated this that \u2013 this that \u2013 this that, so you <unintelligible/>.\nSo they must be c- compo- ehm \u2013 like associated with the human score.\nLike decives them, we first add them, because we \u2013 they are very easy to compute.\nBut we add another human evaluation score, that was the point of ehm th- that I wrote the protocol, like try to come up with some tips.\nSo, we need the na- next try human evaluation, decides them, we compute them, but we add the number of human evaluation, so that we can ehm be sure that we have good  quality.\nThat's the point.\n(PERSON6) I agree with you.\nBut that human evaluation <unintelligible/> should be like very subjective and <unintelligible/>, right?\n(PERSON2) mmhm No, it's not very subjective, it's like \u2013\nwe I \u2013 I think \u2013\ndid you read the document that I wrote?\nThe protocol I wrote?\n(PERSON6) Yes, yes.\n(PERSON2) There is how most of the like evaluations are done in the community, in the literature.\nLike have a summary or a text and we compare it with the reference and we have the annotators th- to compare it.\nAnd they like try to assess different aspects like <unintelligible/> reada- readibility, the quality etc., and they put scores of that.\nAnd then we have this five stars for rating \u2013 <unintelligible/> rating scale, from one to five stars.\nAnd then we abbregate, we wait this ehm \u2013 let say this aspects, and we come up with the \u2013 with the final score.\nThis is the most common and easy way to \u2013 to do it you know.\nThat's why I proposed that.\nBut then [PERSON6] has his own idea about this alignments and I don't really know, I know nothing about, so that's it.\n(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah.\nI \u2013 I \u2013 I got \u2013 I go- got the multimission of ehm the <unintelligible/> meeting script, but still that is like the <unintelligible/> that [PERSON6] ehm is targetting to achieve ehm would you be more objective?\nAnd the liker giving skills, okay, but still I would believe that it is subjective.\n(PERSON2) ehm Yes, I mean \u2013\n(PERSON6) Right.\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON2) It's human based and every \u2013 every human evaluation is subjective, so \u2013\n<unintelligible/>\nEveryone is doing it that way, so \u2013\nI mean most of the research evaluat- human evaluation in nature language generation is done that way, so-\n(PERSON6) Okay, wonderful.\n<typing/>\n<unintelligible/>\nOkay, so, like \u2013\nOkay, so the thing is that if we don't come up ehm with the alignment based manual evaluation <unintelligible/>, we will do as the normally the other energy task <unintelligible/> ehm entries, right?\n(PERSON2) I'm really sorry, I didn't follow you.\n(PERSON6) Yeah, so <parallel_talk/> So \u2013 <parallel_talk/> if we \u2013 if we are like \u2013 if we are not able to come up with the alignment ehm, if we are not able to come up with the alignment based ehm manual evaluation measure, \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes.\n(PERSON6) We go with \u2013 we go with the <unintelligible/>, the <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON2) Yes, sure, sure.\nYes, why not, yes.\nThat's \u2013 yes, okay, why not.\n(PERSON7) Okay, so may I \u2013 may I summarise it, please?\nSo ehm \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yeah.\n(PERSON7) So ehm really ehm we want to use ehm alignment annotation for summarisation, this is variant A.\nBut we have ehm little time and very probably we don't have to ehm prepare this alignments.\nAnd in this case we follow variant B, and this is using ehm human evaluation like readibility and so on, not using the alignment.\n(PERSON6) Right.\n(PERSON7) So \u2013\n(PERSON6) mmhm Yes.\nYes, so ehm \u2013 so the thing is that ehm my ehm <unintelligible/> before November it would be difficult to come up with the alignment this score, so ehm for the past shared task that we have way to propose <unintelligible/> speech,\nI think we should go whatever is available and whatever is better to us.\nAnd then maybe we would also like do some research on this and we come with some beautiful matrix,\nand then maybe the second ehm \u2013 you know the second event <unintelligible/> we can come up with this ehm new <unintelligible/> \u2013 new techniques that we want to do.\nHalo?\n(PERSON2) So this \u2013 this \u2013\nyou were talking to [PERSON7] or to me?\n(PERSON6) ehm I'm talking to you <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON7) <laugh/>\n(PERSON2) So, <laugh/> I'm really confused.\n(PERSON7) <laugh/>\nProbably yes.\nHe just \u2013 you are just trying to summarise what we did and what we said, yes, yes.\n(PERSON6) I'm just worried about like what ehm the proposal should look like, because ehm like for variant B there are still like some cloud on that.\nWe are not very clear.\nSo, ehm I just want that the proposal should be like very strong, and whatever we say shoould have a ground \u2013 grounded this is to that.\n<unintelligible/> so, I now loose \u2013\nI know there are many autoatic measures for summarisation so if we like just put those ehm in the proposal ehm no one we question?\nAnd we \u2013 if we like say that we are going to human evaluation using the ehm like pst- like the reading skill or how they <unintelligible/>, no one we yuestion?\nBut if we are not believed here about the alignment <unintelligible/>, so that's it.\nThat's why my <unintelligible/> nice.\n(PERSON7) ehm I kind of don't know what to say.\nSo ehm, I don't knw what you propose.\nYou propose ehm directly to go plan \u2013 plan B, yes?\n(PERSON6) No, B \u2013 we \u2013 like we have plan B as our backup.\nIf varian A doesn't become clear to us before the proposal submission deadline, we move in variant B.\nIf variant A is very clear, its concensus is accepted by all of us, we obviously go with variant B.\n(PERSON7) mmhm Okay. \n(PERSON6) Yeah.\nOkay, okay.\nOkay, so, yeah so I think \u2013 I think <unintelligible/> no \u2013 <unintelligible/> \u2013\n[PERSON7] you wanted to discuss something?\nI have understood what is <unintelligible/> that [PERSON6] was speaking about.\nYeah, it's how we should do the shared task and \u2013\n(PERSON7) ehm <parallel_talk/> Yeah, so \u2013 <parallel_talk/> so, ehm what I wanted to discuss ehm is probably ehm the format of the basic sample trial.\nBut this is \u2013 I think we should read with this \u2013 that format before [PERSON1] ehm appears and discuss it with [PERSON1].\n(PERSON6) mmhm\n(PERSON7) So this \u2013\nmy \u2013 my point of how to create basic samples should be discussed with [PERSON1] before we ehm go on.\nSo for now I don't prepare any basic samples more.\nAnd then I ehm \u2013\nwh- when [PERSON1] appears ehm I will discussed \u2013 ehm discuss with him, if his annotation tool can work with the <unintelligible/> samples,\nand then prepare ehm the second ehm version of basic samples.\nPoint?\nAnd ehm, as for the data format, this is also a point with [PERSON2] ehm \u2013 \n(PERSON2) As for the data format I'm already clear, like it's what we discussed like the three \u2013 three sections in each file.\nThe first section is meta-data, you put on meta-data there,\nand you're right in ehm <unintelligible/> brackets meta-data.\nAnd then, the second distrust it, as I each <unintelligible/>, so the second and the third are crossed in the summary.\nAnd in the summary you can keep the bullets, but only with dashes.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> one dash, two dashes etc.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON2) So this is \u2013 I think this is the ehm \u2013\nso it's almost like I said, but you can \u2013\nI said to remove the meta-data,\nyou can put them with ehm \u2013 with a label in your <unintelligible/> brackets \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important.\n(PERSON2) So it's \u2013 it's almost the same, so the format is stable <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, this is \u2013\nWell, I think I will have to discuss it with you before I begin once more about some details.\n(PERSON2) Yes, sure, because \u2013 \nyes, <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) But, yes yes, but \u2013\n(PERSON2) But I think this is a \u2013\nbecause this way you put all the information, you put practically put on all information, because you have the meta-data <unintelligible/> the summary.\nThere is nothing <unintelligible/> \u2013\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) Yes, yes.\nSo it's good, isn't it?\nIt was not my point.\n(PERSON2) You deserve the hierarchy of the bullets ehm, but only with <unintelligible/> recognisable, because <unintelligible/> is not recognisable, so.\n(PERSON7) Yes, yes, mmhm.\n(PERSON2) I think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like ehm anonymisation of \u2013 anonymi- anonymisation of the names of this annotators.\nWe need \u2013 we need to encall them, so you have to prepare a list with their real full names and their annot01, annot02, annot03 and that you have to put in the ehm folders.\nSo, you will have to rename [PERSON5].\nYou will keep a list, where [PERSON5] is like [PERSON5] what \u2013 I don't know is her name and then you put annot01, as a sample example.\nAnd then you will use the zer- annot01 as the name to the folder structure that you \u2013 that we have, so you will have to rename the folder structure.\n(PERSON7) [PERSON2], lwt's do it \u2013\nso, the question <unintelligible/> do it when we do it who does it.\nehm So, an I \u2013\n(PERSON2) What do you mean?\nWhat \u2013 ehm what \u2013 what, like renaming in the structure in the directory or the list, or what do you \u2013\n(PERSON7) So, now we are ehm looki-\nwe are ehm kind of ehm changing ehm the data storage from Sorbow to GateHub repository.\n(PERSON2) ehm No, we will keep both of them.\nWe'll keep the <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, I know, but st-\nyes.\nBut we are kind of centralizing it and we're making server as one of mocking versions of GateHub repository, so who is doig all of that?\n(PERSON2) Once again, please, I couldn't hear you.\nWhere are restoring <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON7) Who \u2013 who does all that GateHub ehm things?\n(PERSON2) For the GateHub it's only pushes, I <unintelligible/> do it.\nthere is nothing to do in the GateHub for you.\nYou will just walk in the cluster.\nWhat I was saying is that you or I or together we will have to rename the names in the cluster, all the names.\n(PERSON7) Yes, yes \u2013\n(PERSON2) From [PERSON5] \u2013 from [PERSON5] you will put annot01, like anonymise the name.\n(PERSON7) ehm When?\nBefore ehm a create in GateHub or it doesn't \u2013 ehm or it doesn't \u2013\n(PERSON2) Before pushing, before pushing to Gatehub.\n(PERSON7) Before pushing?\nThis was my question.\n(PERSON2) Yes, yes.\n(PERSON7) So \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes, sure, before pushing.\nBecause in GateHub it has to appear as anonymous, as annot- annot01.\n(PERSON7) <another_language>aha</another_language> Yeah, so before pushing.\nI have to change all the names,\nso it means, that for each annotator I have to change the name form [PERSON5]1, from [ANNOTATOR2] to annot2 \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes.\n(PERSON7) Somebody \u2013\nso \u2013 and if I \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes, so you create the file \u2013 you create the file the document that \u2013 internal \u2013 that you have access to, or even a notebook let say, a paper notebook,\nand you have to keep the \u2013 the names of this collaborators or annotators, their full names \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, this is clear.\n(PERSON2) And an anonymous name that is annot01, annot02, etc., yeah?\nand you will <unintelligible/> record of this list \u2013\n(PERSON7) Perfect, so this is okay, yes.\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> record of this list when you name the folders with their collaborators.\n(PERSON7) Yes, so this is \u2013 this is what \u2013\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) This is what I like.\nIf I \u2013 if I am allowed to do it so, I like it so.\nBecause ehm I'm not able at the moment, I'm not sure if I can be \u2013 if I can make <unintelligible/> but I \u2013 at the moment it is very complicated for me to anonymise ehm all of the files to \u2013 so to name general names.\nI have to keep the names \u2013 this final names of the files recognisable.\nSo it may \u2013 it should not be the name of the annotator, but it should be some ID that I can ehm dete- that I can determine where to put it. \n(PERSON2) Yes, I told you, annot01 is like \u2013\n(PERSON7) Yes, yes, in this case it is a <unintelligible/>, so nw my task is to rename the files.\n(PERSON2) yes, but before that I also have \u2013\nI mean, I also propose some other things but you didn't have time to discuss them, so, I'm not sure \u2013\n(PERSON7) So, let's meet today, [PERSON2], let's meet today in person?\n<unintelligible/> to <unintelligible/> more \u2013\n(PERSON2) [PERSON6] would be \u2013 better to have also [PERSON6],\nI don't know, when he's available now, or tomorrow, or \u2013\nso maybe it's better to set up another meeting, like today \u2013\nlike one of the day in the morning?\nSo, I think [PERSON6] \u2013\n(PERSON7) So, just <unintelligible/> \u2013\nokay, okay.\nSo let's write \u2013 write [PERSON6] when he has time, so \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes it would be very good.\n(PERSON7) Or I can <unintelligible/> Friday and <unintelligible/> again,\nI have web seminars <unintelligible/> Thursday \u2013\n(PERSON2) Probably, tomorrow morning or evenyou want today afternoon or some time?\nIt would be very good to have also [PERSON6] to seome things.\n(PERSON7) Yes.\n(PERSON2) Because I'm really worried about this team that he's proposing, so,\nI <unintelligible/> disagree with [PERSON6] about several things, so we nedd to discuss <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON7) Yes, <unintelligible/> be everybody <unintelligible/> in person, yes, perf- \nehm I agree.\n(PERSON7) So ehm \u2013\n(PERSON2) So \u2013\n(PERSON7) I'll write him and you now and \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes, try to \u2013 we try to catch him.\n(PERSON7) <unintelligible/> meeting tomorrow morning.\n(PERSON2) \nwe try to catch him as soon as possible.\n(PERSON7) Yes, not today, I am already at home \u2013 <parallel_talk/> <unintelligible/> <parallel_talk/>\nWhat?\n(PERSON2) Okay.\n<unintelligible/> the meeting.\nI will \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yes, sure.\n(PERSON7) Okay. \n(PERSON6) Yes, <unintelligible/> something like the meeting of today, you were also present <unintelligible/> \u2013\n(PERSON2) Yeah.\n(PERSON6) Repeat the one today.\n(PERSON7) Okay.\n(PERSON6) Okay, okay.\nOkay, so now we're just \u2013\nlike everything is ehm like almost sorted.\nthe thing is that we have to like wait for [PERSON1] <unintelligible/> to actually ehm <unintelligible/> that \u2013 <unintelligible/> this annotation tool composed for new <unintelligible/> idea.\n(PERSON7) mmhm Yeah, [PERSON4] is writing.\nI was waiting and tried install [ORGANIZATION2] again and with different e-mail adress.\nNow it asking me meeting password.\nCould someone please provide <unintelligible/> to my lock?\nDo you let me know if something concers me?\nHe needs some password to <unintelligible/>, what does it mean?\nWhich password?\nMeeting password, what is that?\n(PERSON6) I think the meeting pass-\nyeah, the meeting password is minuting, which is already there in the meeting <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON7) Could you \u2013 could it \u2013 could you please send it to [PERSON4]?\n(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON7) But anyway, I would rather probably finish it for today.\n(PERSON6) mmhm Yeah, okay.\nI too think so.\n(PERSON7) mmhm\n(PERSON6) [PERSON2], anything else you want to discuss?\n(PERSON7) No.\n(PERSON2) ehm No, I mean I definitely \u2013 with definitely <unintelligible/> with [PERSON6] to \u2013\nbecause today we didn't finish, like we left some issues without dicsussing them, so ehm \u2013\nWe cannot really discuss anything without [PERSON6], because ehm \u2013\n(PERSON6) Exactly, yeah.\nThere are like decission points, decisions points has to take, so yeah.\n(PERSON2) So, there is nothing to discuss today anymore.\nOkay \u2013\n(PERSON7) So, have a nice evening, everybody.\n(PERSON2) Okay, goodbye.\n(PERSON6) Yeah.\n(PERSON7) Bye bye.\n(PERSON6) Goodbye, and stay <unintelligible/>.\nBye bye.\n(PERSON7) You too. \n \nI'm not, you know, wanting is like, yes?\nYes, in this case, it is he.\nSo now my task is to return...\n", "utterances": [["20230920:093325", "user", " Who are the participants of the meeting ?",
