deadline has already come now.\nIt is November 30th.\n(PERSON2) November 3rd?\n(PERSON1) November 30th. \nfeasible\nEnd of November.\n(PERSON2) End of November,\nokay. \nUhm.\n(PERSON1) He guess.\nSo we have to <unintelligible/>about the data about the even mission metrics.\nTho- these may change actually,\nbut the proposal should look good with all the all the-\n(PERSON2) Yes, yes.\n(PERSON1) Like with all the components, \nyou know.\n(PERSON2) Yes.\n(PERSON1) And I <unintelligible/>  I should be able to get back to all of you uh by the end of the week with the [ORGANIZATION1] data set.\nYeah, I think I think I can.\nI can lay-\n(PERSON2)  So you are now-\nso now you are active uhm you are you are wo- work in hard on [ORGANIZATION1].\nYes?\n(PERSON1) Yes, yes, \nI think they if should get ready by the end of the week.\n(PERSON2) Uhm, we- uhm.\nWeek ago you said  that it should have been ready to by the end of the last week.\nSo actually, actually kind of wait expected that today we will discuss the annotations and these alignment tool by [PERSON6].\nSo how it will this this [PERSON6]-\n(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> I actually uhm.\nI'm not really sure if we should not no no.\nI don't mean that I do-\nWell.\nBy the end of November should we uhm get some new aligned data.\nBy using [PERSON6]'s tool.\nAnd already made by annotators.\nDo we <unintelligible/> it the end of November,\nshould we started now \nand be really quick in giving to an <unintelligible/>?\nReally takes time before we start this annotators work.\nShould we started?\nWhat do you think?\n(PERSON1) Uhm.\nI'm not really sure about-\nlike this should be started.\nBut I don't think that we can put that in the proposal.\nThis can start-\n(PERSON2) Okay.\n(PERSON1) I'mmediately but for the for the fast shared task I'm not sure like we have <unintelligible/> clear or on the <unintelligible/> of using the alignment thing.  \n(PERSON2) Okay.\nUm.\n(PERSON1) So the <unintelligible/> [PERSON2] like uhm I <unintelligible/> late personally I would prefer the shared task to be as simple as possible, \nbecause even the task is hard.\nThat I have late available realized by now.\n(PERSON2) Uhm.\n(PERSON1) So like if you the keep like keeping the major focus on the summarization part.\nLike to to build summaries very close to how how the <unintelligible/> are.\nShould be the main focus.\nAnd the in like uhm this envisioned to lose the evolution metrics that we are going to propose. \nShould come in the second <unintelligible/> like uhm not in the fast shared task.\nBecause that will be like then then we will mixing up too many things in one in one place.\n(PERSON2) Uhm,\nwell, I'm not sure if understand all the details.\nUhm.\n(PERSON1) So I'm saying like uhm little skip the fast shared task as simple as possibly.\nLike we have already some evaluation metrics like <unintelligible/> and other evaluation metrics that we have.\nOkay and we also have a manualy evaluation think that is prepared by [PERSON3].\nAnd I think it's it's good that we can involve annotators to-\n(PERSON2) But does <unintelligible/> has does <unintelligible/> have at least some minimal sense, \ndoesn't <unintelligible/> give some totaly unr- unrealistic numbers that doesn't that don't say anything serious about the quality of the annotations.\nUhm.\n(PERSON3) <unintelligible/> says, but <unintelligible/> we are in a community.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\nIt's it's for summarization the rules is that <unintelligible/>.\nYou know like, yeah.\nI know like we that that <unintelligible/> that.\nBut it's the <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) So actually, \nwhy we want to run this [PERSON6]'s tool is that <unintelligible/> has actually no real sense run estimating the summariz on the one hand, \nand on the other hand that manual metrix, manual evolutions that we have now are very very subjective and uhm kind of also very wake.\nAnd in these keys using the alignment could give us a little more than <unintelligible/> when at the community.\n(PERSON1) Yesss.\nYes.\n(PERSON2) Probably if we don't put at in to the shared task, \nwe kind of don't use-\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\n(PERSON2) We could you.\n(PERSON1) It <unintelligible/> this investigation this desert should definitelly go in the background.\nAh, for the alignment thing,\nbecause this this this could be on new contribution from all in.\n(PERSON2) Yeah.\n(PERSON1) So this should <unintelligible/> going the background.\nBut ah like a convincing the convincing the reviews about the alignment tool.\n(PERSON2) Yes, this-\n(PERSON1) The proposal would be difficult so I would propose-\n(PERSON2) Maybe <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\nI would propose, \nyeah, so I would propose that uh before aaa like making the alignment to <unintelligible/> part of shared tasks datas get the people on <unintelligible/> exceptive somewhere.\nAnd maybe <unintelligible/>-\n(PERSON2) Okay.\n(PERSON1) the data set the alignment tool gated accepted by the community.\nAnd then we can refer that.\nOkay.\nThis is on ready exceptive and so yeah.\nPeople can use this. \n(PERSON2) Um-hum.\n(PERSON1) So.\nWhat they actually minutes that for the shared task get as go with the really conventional thing that people do for summarization.\nTake use rules.\nYou some other evaluation metrics like <unintelligible/> some \nor like there were <unintelligible/> metrics late.\nUhm using word <unintelligible/> words distance and stops.\nUhm, so other than rules.\n(PERSON2) Uhm probab- so I am  eager so I actually want to prepared to relieve you \nand I really trust for this questions.\nI not so experienced in then, \nbut maybe you could also discussed it with [PERSON4] once more.\nSo uhm it's in in these aspect you are definitely are are more experienced, \nand uhm but please discussed discussed it with [PERSON4] before.\n(PERSON1) Yy, yes.\nYes, actually [PERSON2], I was I was thinking too uhm evaluate some meetings based on the based on the automatic evaluation metrics that we have.\nAnd then show <unintelligible/> to all of us. \nAnd then we can decide that uhm which which evaluation metrics we can <unintelligible/> we can <unintelligible/> for the shared task. \nMaybe.\n(PERSON2) Could you try these metrics on the meeting on these meeting?\nOn these <unintelligible/> set uhm I'm not set we will evalu- evaluate make.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah. \nOkay. \nOh, okay, okay\nSo but-\n(PERSON2) So that we could get manual evalutions and also some automatic metrics, \nand then compare them.\n(PERSON1) Yes, you are okay. \nSo [PERSON2], when do you need this till me.\nI will schedule accordingly.\nWhen do you need?\n(PERSON2) Well, I don't really needed.\nI want to know what  I do myself to be as uhm so af- so as effective as possible.\nSo.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\n(PERSON2) So you actually <unintelligible/>.\nSo you you are time limited.\nProbably-\n(PERSON1) Hello?\n(PERSON2) Yes, \nI'm thinking <laugh/>.\n(PERSON1) So okay.\nSo [PERSON2] what you do is like want you have the minutes from all of your participants.\nSend me this. \nAnd maybe within a deal <unintelligible/> back with you all the evaluation metrics.\n(PERSON2) Yes. Okay.\nBut maybe in this case, if you have a clear understanding what should we prepare before the end of November, \ntell me what should I do?\nWhat should I gi- give you before this.\nSend email.\n(PERSON1) Yes. \nSo I what I we do now is maybe from tomorrow on works I will start writing like <unintelligible/>\nI have already the components nearly.\nSo it start drafting and then uhm we will definitely come up with some gaps that we need to killer.\nThen I will be late I can I can see that uhm what other things we require.\nBut like uhm the <unintelligible/> lotion is to keep as uhm <unintelligible/> simplest as possibly.\nSo whatever we have we do the fast shared task with those.\nAnd in the midway in the background we <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Uhm. \n(PERSON1) Yeah.\nOkay.\nYeah, so yeah.\nIf you say, that standpoint on my hand it's too like uhm give you the bit give you all the <unintelligible/> [ORGANIZATION1] data which should be ready,\nbecause the minutes I have downloaded.\nThe only thing that is <unintelligible/> too properly align with the properly align with the corresponding trasncripts.\nSo I have to find way to do that.\nAnd <unintelligible/> also like uhm prepare in the form like the basics sample form that you require.\nRight?\nAs far the [PROJECT1] meetings.\n(PERSON2) No I'm totally lost. \n(PERSON1) So I'm saying that for for the you-\n(PERSON2) Firts, so.\n(PERSON1) For the [ORGANIZATION1] data set, you need the data in the form like our [PROJECT1] meetings.\nRight?\n(PERSON2) Yes.\n(PERSON1) Yes, so that is <unintelligible/> from my part .\nI have to do that.\n(PERSON2) Yes. \nYes.\n(PERSON1) And <unintelligible/> with to you <unintelligible/> finally data.\nYeah.\n(PERSON2) Uhm. \n<other_noise/>\nAnd what I- \nyes, this from [ORGANIZATION1] it's clear to me. \nWhat is not clear to me is what we do with the alignment of transcripts and minutes now.\nUhm did you already tried this [PERSON6]'s tool,\ndid you think about how to organize this annotators work.\nDo we begin it now?\nDo we begin it next week after you already with [ORGANIZATION1] corpus\nor don't or we don't begin it at all, \nbecause as your seen it is not actuall for this shared task.\n(PERSON1) No, [PERSON2].\nI I think we should begin.\nI think we should begin <unintelligible/> take the charge.\nBecause I would be now fully focused till November 30th on the shared task proposal. \n(PERSON2) But who?\nI can't, I can't.\nSo you are the only person who understand how this [PERSON6]'s tool wor- functions.\n[PERSON6] is not working for that.\nSo I really need person,\nwho will really <unintelligible/> help me to begin work with annotators. \n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah.\nSo I think uhm can uhm because I think [PERSON5] was also working on integrating something into the tool\nand yeah she knows.\n(PERSON2) Where is [PERSON5] actually?\nShe is not with us somehow, \nbut I see her online. \nUhm.\n(PERSON1) So uhm.\n(PERSON2) So you, you want to you want to transfer this task to [PERSON5]?\n(PERSON1) Not exactly.\nI would say that I would do it once \nand like uhm once I'm done with the [ORGANIZATION1] thing\nand I believe <unintelligible/> proposal. \nBecause uhm.\n(PERSON2) Yes, but that means after<unintelligible/> end of November.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, maybe.\nYeah.\n(PERSON2) Because I actually I'm kind of waiting all the times,\nso I don't really understand. \nIf I should stop waiting <laugh/>,\nso uhm okay.\nBecau-\nSo in this case either I wait to December.\nOr you transform this task to [PERSON5].\nAnd uhm explain her how to I don't know work with anno-\nSo this is really I don't know at all how this techn- technical part works.\n(PERSON1) Uhm.\n(PERSON2) And [PERSON3] indeed <unintelligible/> help with this task.\nI don't want how to begin.\nSo I know how to in how to work within the tool,\nbut uhm if uhm I send the link to the inc- to this tol- to my annotors \nand they have some questions, \nand they will have some questions, definitely because this is written in Python,\nand Python mostly has problems when install in that tool.\nYou also experienced such problems.\nAnd it-\nSo\nIf the annotators come ups with questions,\nI would never able to answer.\nSo I really need a person who would be uhm by hand,\nso it would really help me all the time and in in this.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, so one thing that we need to be sure about the tool is like the tool is doing annotators uhm like alignment <unintelligible/>.\nSo but the thing is that once the once the annotator does the alignment,\nso what is the output of the tools.\nIt should be some manual score or metric or what.\nSo that I think you need some discussion.\n(PERSON2) Why metric?\nThis is just a alignment, just which part of what-\nSo you mean uhm how it is can be useful for evaluation.\nBut this is another question yes, \nbut this is not before that.\nWe sh- uhm\nYes, this is important question.\nBut this is not just for that.\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON1) Yeah, once we do the alignment, \nunderstand.\nOkay. \nThen I will tool is doing alignment,\nso how <unintelligible/> going to use the alignment.\nSo that question also let should coming early.\n(PERSON2) Uhm, so you should think it's come it should come immediately uhm at the same time?\n(PERSON1) Yes.\n(PERSON2) Okay. \nFrom <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON1) No, we <unintelligible/> able outcome from the tools.  \n(PERSON2) We need a <unintelligible/> idea how to use it.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, exactly.\nSuppose we use the alignment.\nAnd then um we don't know how to use that.\n(PERSON2) No.\n(PERSON1) So yes, for example, if you see uhm that Jens that minutes fix just smaller part of the transcript \nor uhm then so then they get less as smaller number of kind of in these evaluation.\nThis is what we discussed with [PERSON4] once,\nand I <unintelligible/> objection to that because it is not so uhm evident.\nSo his idea was that say for example, \nif  there is if the uhm crossling between transkript and minutes is smaller than the quality of the minutes is also worse.\nUhm but it from from from my opinion it should not be always the case.\nOh, because it could also be that some pieces of transcripts are unimportant or on the contrary.\nSo it's not so straightforward.\nAt this moment I don't have any clear answer to your question\nand I also understand that it should be.\nUhm it should be stated clearly, \nbut I I me and [PERSON4] have kind of strong intuition that it could help by evaluating.\nUhm.\n(PERSON1) Yeah. <unintelligible/>\nYeah, that is that is very much clear, \nthat if we definitely help for the evaluation, \nbecause oh yeah what you think in machine translation this alignment tool or alignment metric is uhm like very helps.\nSimilar I think <unintelligible/> go for summarization when we see that <unintelligible/> models <unintelligible/> very good.\nWhich is eventually alignment.\nBut the thing is like once we give this thing to our annotators.\nI would really want to see that some tangible things come <unintelligible/>.\nSo once the alignment this done then mix work.\n(PERSON2) Okay. \n(PERSON1) One we-\n(PERSON2) Okay,\nwhat tangible thing could be that uhm and the result you can't you you get.\nAlign of summary.\nAnd a piece of transcript.\nSo kind of a structured uhm transkript into pieces where one line of summary corresponds to a piece of transcripts.\nSo you don't have a very long transcript \nand very long and very big minutes.\nBut you really ha- have a summarization office small piece of text.\nSo it could be so the text could be divided according of that, \nand that data in this are kind of March and Margaret in this way.\nSo this is one of outputs.\nDo you get-\ndo you understand what I'm trying to say?\n(PERSON1) Hm.\nYeah, I've I've got it.\nSo you mean to say that uhm we have aligned aligned minute and transcript?\nAnd that is the that is the current output.\nAnd then we think that how to leverage on that.\n(PERSON2) No, no, no.\nNo.\nI just saying that this is already a good advantage to have smaller pieces of transcripts, and a correspondent summary line.\nSo <unintelligible/> we have other type of data somehow,\nthat not just big one hour long transcripts,\nand long too pages long minutes.\nBut we also get the output like ten lines of transcript \nand one line of minute.\nSo enlarge so the datas different qualitatively different data set.\nVery have many, many pieces of transcripts \nand many, many corresponding lines of summary.\nSo it could be kind also ano- uhm good training data.\nBetter.\n(PERSON1) Yeah. \nOkay.\n(PERSON2)  I'm not sure if I'm say- saying it clear enough.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.\nSo uhm so what <unintelligible/> [PERSON2], \nI I I absolutely support you that we should start the this alignment thing with our annotators.\nSoon.\nBut I'm I'm not sure that if if we should include that evaluation part as part of <unintelligible/> shared task. \nBecause there are still many questions unanswered.\n(PERSON2) Uhm.\n(PERSON1) How how are do we going to.\n(PERSON2) Yes, okay.\nUhm. \nI I've got what you said \nand now I'm still wondering will work on that and when.\nSo really kind of administrative  have this admi- administrative problem, \nbecause I want to <unintelligible/> \nand I don't know how technical.\nBecause the tool is actually ready.\nBut there is some connection is missing that.\nSomebody should say how to download the meeting, \nwhat to click to make it work, \nand where to put the data.\n(PERSON1) Okay.\nOkay, yeah.\nI can I can-\n(PERSON2) If you want to transfer it if you want to transfer it  to [PERSON5] maybe it would be also possible.\nPlease then go [PERSON5] and you to just agree who is doing that.\nAnd agree on the details.\nI think it-\n(PERSON5) I'm here <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Yeah, hi.\n(PERSON5) I was listening to you all the time, \nso you said.\n(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> really?\n<laugh/>\nI didn't hear aha now I seen see you,\nbecause I just looked at them for uhm some minutes ago,\nI didn't see you, \nthat's why I was writing you.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, I joined there there was a network problem.\n(PERSON2) By teh way these time <unintelligible/> one instead of to.\nWe started an hour earlier than normally today.\n(PERSON1) No is it?\n(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>\n<unintelligible/>\n(PERSON2) Yes, we had a <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON5) <unintelligible/>\n(PERSON2) Well, it is actually okay and and I don't I don't mind it we started one, \nbut <unintelligible/> now we have one.\n<unintelligible/> one.\n(PERSON1) Uhm. \nOkay.\nYeah I think uhm I can work to I can work on that.\nBut I think I'm a bit too much uhm like worried about the proposal.\nAnd also that like to create the data set before like we to have a good data of the [ORGANIZATION1] thing to be release just part of the shared task.\nUhm so I don't <unintelligible/> if [PERSON5] will be comfortable to do that.\nOr otherwise eventually I can do that, \nbut maybe I I will require some more time.\n(PERSON5) Uhm are you talking about the [ORGANIZATION1] corpus creation?\n(PERSON2) No.\n(PERSON1) No, no , no.\n(PERSON2) [PERSON6]'s alignment toll and starting align transript sum- summarize.\n(PERSON5) Yeah.\nSo I'm comfortable with it.\nIf you want to transfer it's okay with me.\n(PERSON1) Yeah,\nif you if you want to start uhm you can.\nMaybe I will join you within a week once this things are very <unintelligible/> sorted out.\n(PERSON2) But uhm may I ask [PERSON5] and Thirtankar if you could just join to you to together\nand discr- and discuss the technical details.\nAnd and how we how the work could be started.\nSay till I don't know. \nThursday.\nFriday.\nSo that we could already speak about on Friday and started on Monday.\n(PERSON1) Uhm.\nSo you are looking forward the start <unintelligible/> for the annotators to do the annotations from Monday on worse.\nNext Monday on worse, okay?\n(PERSON2) Are are <unintelligible/> I'm looking forward to started from this from September, \nbecause I think we have a lot of data\nand I'm so I'm still waiting on terms for creating uhm kind of uhm double summarize for meetings that are already minuted.\nAnd I am afraid we they will <unintelligible/> annotators will be away,\nbecause they start <unintelligible/> finish before they make <unintelligible/> alignment.\nSo I would be very glad to uhm make the task the anno- ask the annotators to make the alignment.\nI'm sure if we will have enough money next year for example.\nSo it's really important.\nIt's a big very big work this alignment it really take a lot of time.\n(PERSON5) Uhm.\n(PERSON2) 130 minutes for English.\nAnd 110 minutes for Czech.\nIt's really very, very big work.\nAnd <unintelligible/> to be started as as soon as possible.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\nOkay, so, and and annotating [PERSON2] I would one to mention like before <unintelligible/> giving the minutes to the annotators we must be sure that which transkripts or minutes <unintelligible/> really part of the data set, \nbecause some of them-\n(PERSON2) Yes.\n(PERSON1) Has <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) Yes.\nI think about it.\nI think about that, \nand probably excludes some <unintelligible/> meetings, \nand some other meetings \nand I uhm I will definitely start with imaging center of the shore <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON1) Okay.\n(PERSON5) So [PERSON2] what exactly do you want as one from us like to start the annotation work, because I think we should do it as soon as possible, \nbecause it will it is going to get a lot of time.\n(PERSON2) [PERSON1] knows that.\nBecause he spoke with <unintelligible/> \nand he will explain you what to do.\nAnd after you <unintelligible/> the topic, \nwe will <unintelligible/> discuss it on Friday.\nAnd then I expect that you will say me, \nwhat should I say to annotators.\nSo.\nWhat what <unintelligible/> I just try to my annotator know you will do the alignment of this and this,\nyou find guidelines on this link.\nThis are these are the guidelines that we already-\n(PERSON5) Okay.\n(PERSON2)  created by a [PERSON6] and me.\nAnd <unintelligible/> his girlfriend, who is <unintelligible/> annotators.\nAnd please install it here,\nif you have problems with installation makes so and so.\nAnd but especially if we want to know uhm just I don't know where is the data are,\nhow they get to the data.\nSo this is what I'm not sure about.\nOh just the whole process of annotations so for on your sight is the decision how the annotation looks look <unintelligible/> where is the data,\ndo I send the data, \nwe have once started to put all our data to GitHub,\nbut we didn't finish it.\nSo how now I'm <unintelligible/> sure what to do with the data.\n(PERSON1) [PERSON2], okay, okay.\nSo I <unintelligible/> by the end of this week you have will you will have answers to all of this.\n(PERSON2) Okay. \nThank you.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\nSo by the end of the week, \nwe will have answers to all of this to connect to the annotators.\nAnd you <unintelligible/> we can also <unintelligible/> session with your annotators to show them that how to do it.\n(PERSON2) Yes, yes.\nBut yes- <unintelligible/>\nFirst we speak about it but that I will I can org- so this is the topic you ar- you actually promised me last week that we could make this call with annotators but what do we <unintelligible/> them?\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\n(PERSON2) Thank you.\nThis is definitely what you what I need.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, okay.\n(PERSON2) Uhm.\n(PERSON1) Okay,\nthis will be done.\nBy the end of this week.\nThis should be done.\n(PERSON2) Perfect.\nThank you.\nNow it seems that our talk is remain aha six minutes remaining.\nOkay.\n(PERSON5) So if you want my help, \n[PERSON1] you can let me know, if I have-\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nI I have to schedule a session with you [PERSON5], \nbecause uhm there are too many things on my plate now,\nso I will definitely need hands.\n(PERSON5) Yeah, yeah.\nYou can tell me whatever you one may help with.\nI will do that.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, sure, sure.\n(PERSON5) Uhm.\n(PERSON1) And and any decision points from [PERSON4],\nbecause [PERSON3] was mentioning that we even to talk [PERSON4] regarding some decision questions.\nSo are there things on our plate?\n(PERSON2) From my sight nothing happend.\nBecause  I I didn't speak with [PERSON4].\nI had the f- so  I think we ho- we will as- he will join us uhm when we discuss the evaluation maybe,\nnot today.\n(PERSON1) Uhm.\n(PERSON2) Uhm I didn't speak to him, \nI didn't so uhm we don't have the con- concrete topic to ask him,\nso so I didn't do it.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah.\nOkay, so let me know things now.\n(PERSON2) If you noted to the agenda, \nit will be it would be great.\nI didn-\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah.\n(PERSON2) Fine it's really it's really <unintelligible/> do in but to the <unintelligible/> do that.\n(PERSON1) Okay, we put that to the agenda,\nlike I'm like <unintelligible/> so many things,\nso it's the proposal that data for [ORGANIZATION1] \nand uhm and a tool.\nAnnotators tool.\n(PERSON2) Yes. \n(PERSON1) Okay.\nOkay, okay [PERSON2].\nSo I think I think we can have something by the end of the week for all of this.\n(PERSON2) Yeah, perfect.\nPerfect.\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\n(PERSON2) Well, okay.\nIs it all for today?\n(PERSON1) Yeah, okay, okay from my sight.\nAnything [PERSON3] would like to add maybe?\n(PERSON3) Uhm, no.\n(PERSON2) 3 minutes.\n<laugh/>\n(PERSON1) Yeah.\n(PERSON2) Okay.\nWell then have nice time \nand that's work hard.\n(PERSON1) Yes, and now the deadline <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON2) I'm I'm looking forward to that [ORGANIZATION1] data to <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[PERSON2], you should you should have it by the end of this week.\n(PERSON2) Are really uhm eager to see them.\nReally-\n(PERSON1) Yeah, yeah.\n(PERSON2) How it look.\n(PERSON1) Okay.\n(PERSON2) Well, thanks.\nAnd <unintelligible/>.\n(PERSON1) Thank you. \nYeah.\n<unintelligible/> take care.\n(PERSON5) Okay, bye bye guys.\n(PERSON1) We will see tommorrow, yeah. \nBy there.\n", "utterances": [["20230918:084529", "user", " Who attended the meeting ?",
