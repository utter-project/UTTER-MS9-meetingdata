**REMARKS**

again found this kind of correct answer in weird style “In the conversation, it is not explicitly mentioned who is in charge of contacting people from [ORGANIZATION6] and [ORGANIZATION5] to find reviewers for the deliverable. However, it can be inferred that [PERSON7] took on that responsibility as they mentioned emailing colleagues in [ORGANIZATION6] and [ORGANIZATION5] to ask them to review the deliverable.”
